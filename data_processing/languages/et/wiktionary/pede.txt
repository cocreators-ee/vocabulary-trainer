Usage notes

When used as a last word of a compound word, then it's intended to mean that the person referred to has a perverse or ridiculous interest in something, not that they're also homosexual. Some commonly used words are autopede (a guy with an over-the-top interest in cars) and reidipede (someone who spends too much time on the website rate.ee (the Estonian equivalent of Facebook, popular in the 2000s).
