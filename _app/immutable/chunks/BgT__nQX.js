It literally translates to 'with the/day' but functions as a polite daytime farewell or greeting. The expression combines 'päev' (day) with the adessive case ending '-ga', indicating accompaniment or association - essentially saying something like 'with a good day'. This is commonly used when parting ways during daylight hours, often as a standalone phrase to wish someone well for the remainder of their day.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:o};export{o as context,t as default,e as sentences,a as translation,n as understood};
