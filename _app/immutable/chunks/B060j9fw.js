It expresses a strong desire or intention. It can be used both transitively (with an object, like 'I want ice cream') and intransitively ('I want to go'). The dictionary notes it carries a nuance of stronger will than the synonym 'haluta'.  The form 'tahtoa' is the 3rd person singular present indicative form, but the word inflects extensively depending on tense, mood, and person.
