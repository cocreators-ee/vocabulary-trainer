It emphasizes exclusivity or limitation in various contexts - when something is done only for a particular reason, when referring to the number of people excluded from consideration, or when indicating someone being completely alone. The word breaks down into components like 'ainu' (only) + 'üksi' (alone/together), reinforcing its meaning of exclusivity.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:i};export{i as context,t as default,e as sentences,n as translation,o as understood};
