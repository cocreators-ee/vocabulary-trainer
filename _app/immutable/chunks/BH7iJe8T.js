It can also mean to confess sins or wrongdoing, especially in religious contexts ('Ta tunnistas preestrile oma patte'). In legal contexts, it refers to giving testimony or evidence ('Homme ma lähen tema vastu tunnistama'). Additionally, it means to recognize or acknowledge authority or truth ('Ta ei tunnista keisri võimu'), and can be used in passive constructions where someone is declared guilty of a crime ('Mees tunnistasid mõrvas süüdi').
