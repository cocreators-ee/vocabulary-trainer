It describes something having a large extent from side to side. The word declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'leveän' is the genitive singular form (of what?), while 'leveät' is the nominative plural form (who/what?). The suffix '-ä' indicates the basic adjective stem, and there are related forms like 'leveämpi' for comparative ('wider') and 'levein' for superlative ('widest').",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:i,context:t};export{t as context,a as default,e as sentences,i as translation,n as understood};
