It indicates that something has a higher degree of importance compared to other things. The dictionary shows it can be used in contexts where someone or something is considered the most important element ('a ja o') - essentially saying they are 'the be-all and end-all' of a situation. In English, this corresponds to words like 'more important', 'more significant', or 'weightier'.",i={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:o};export{o as context,i as default,t as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
