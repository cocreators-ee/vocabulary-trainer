It primarily functions as 'that', introducing subordinate clauses expressing objects of verbs, results, consequences, reasons, or causes. Additionally, it can mean 'in order to' or 'to', indicating purpose ('jotta' is also used for this), and even introduce quotations or interrogative clauses.  It can also be used emphatically, similar to saying 'so you're telling me...' in English. The form 'etten', 'ettemme', etc., are negative contractions used with the verb 'ei'. It’s important to note that dialects may prefer 'jotta' instead of 'että' for certain uses.",i={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,t as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
