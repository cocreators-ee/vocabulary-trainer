It can refer to the device itself (a radio receiver), the medium of broadcasting, or even the act of listening to the radio. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, indicating its role in a sentence. For example, 'radion' is the genitive form meaning 'of the radio', and 'radioon' is the illative form meaning 'to/into the radio'. It can also be used to create compound words like 'autoradio' (car radio) or 'lyhytaaltoradio' (shortwave radio).",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:i};export{i as context,n as default,e as sentences,o as translation,t as understood};
