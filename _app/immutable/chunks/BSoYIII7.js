It is the comparative form of 'kauge' (far/distant). When used alone, it can also imply 'more' in certain contexts. In the first sentence, 'Ta ootis kauem' means 'He/she waited longer'. The second sentence shows comparison: 'I ran longer than you did'. The third example uses 'kauemalt' (from kauem) to mean 'looking at it from a distance/further consideration'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:a};export{a as context,n as default,e as sentences,o as translation,t as understood};
