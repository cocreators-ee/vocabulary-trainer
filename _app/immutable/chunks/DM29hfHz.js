const n=!0,e=["Ma vaatasin filme eile","Meie lemmikfilmid on head filmid","Tere tulemast vaatama filme!"],i=["films","movies","cinema"],t=`"Filme" is the partitive form of the Estonian word "film" (movie/film). In Estonian, the partitive case is used when talking about an indefinite quantity or some instances of something. So "filme" means 'some films' or 'films' in a general sense, rather than specific, complete films. It's commonly used when you're referring to movies as a concept or category, rather than particular movies.`,o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:i,context:t};export{t as context,o as default,e as sentences,i as translation,n as understood};
