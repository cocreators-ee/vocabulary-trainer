It describes something that is positioned approximately at 90 degrees to the horizontal surface, like when someone stands up straight on their legs, objects are placed vertically, or buildings are erected upright. The word can also be used figuratively to maintain one's dignity, composure, or resolve (e.g., 'pea püsti' - keep your head held high). In compound forms with other words, it intensifies meaning to mean 'completely' or 'utterly' (e.g., 'püsti hull' - completely crazy).",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:s};export{s as context,o as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
