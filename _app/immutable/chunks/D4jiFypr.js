In Estonian, when something becomes bad or makes one feel bad in an emotional sense, it can be expressed using this case. The elative case often indicates movement out from something, but here it's used to express a state of becoming angry or upset about something. This is similar to English expressions like 'it makes me angry' or 'I get upset about'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,s as translation,a as understood};
