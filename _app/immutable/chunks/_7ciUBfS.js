It's often used in compound words with nouns to indicate what something deserves or is worthy of (like 'tänuväärt' for 'worthy of thanks'). In common expressions like 'pole tänu väärt!' it means 'you're welcome' literally saying 'not worth a thank you'. The word comes from Middle Low German 'wert' meaning 'worthy'. Examples: 'Kalliskivi on oma hinda väärt' (The gemstone is worth its price) and 'Ta on tõesti üks väärt inimene' (He is truly a worthy person).",i={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:t,context:e};export{e as context,i as default,o as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
