In these examples, it's used to indicate the source of understanding (about this), the topic of discussion (about this theme), and the reference point for memory (from this incident).",i={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,t as sentences,e as translation,o as understood};
