It comes from Proto-Finnic and has connections to Germanic words relating to trails. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, and possessive suffixes indicating who owns the 'raita'. For example, 'raitani' means 'my stripe', while 'raitamme' means 'our stripe'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:a,context:i};export{i as context,s as default,n as sentences,a as translation,o as understood};
