It refers to the substance from which something is made or used, or a set of resources used for a specific purpose. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'materiaali' is the nominative singular form, while 'materiaalit' is the nominative plural form. Possessive forms also exist, like 'materiaalini' (my material).
