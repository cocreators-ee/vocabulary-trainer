In English grammar, this corresponds to the possessive case or 'of the book'. It indicates that something belongs to a book or relates to a book in some way. For example, 'raamatu ostmine' means 'buying of the book' or 'the buying of the book', and 'põnev raamatu' could mean 'an exciting book' though this construction is less common than using the nominative form directly.",n={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,n as default,o as sentences,t as translation,e as understood};
