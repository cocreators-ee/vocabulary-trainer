It can also refer to a coin worth one cent. Colloquially, it can even mean 'centimetre'. The declension shows how the word changes based on its grammatical role in a sentence – nominative 'sentti' is used for the subject, genitive 'sentin' indicates possession, partitive 'senttiä' represents an indefinite amount, and so on.  The possessive forms show who owns the cents (e.g., 'senttini' means 'my cents').
