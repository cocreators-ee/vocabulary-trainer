It's used to connect clauses and provide additional information about people or things. Specifically, 'jotka' is the plural form of the relative pronoun 'jonka', which corresponds to English 'that/which'. In Finnish grammar, relative pronouns agree in number with the noun they refer to - so 'jotka' is used when referring to multiple people or things (plural), while 'jonka' would be used for singular references.",i={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:n,context:e};export{e as context,i as default,o as sentences,n as translation,t as understood};
