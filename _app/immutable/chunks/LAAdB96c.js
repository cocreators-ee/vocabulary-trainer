It refers to the continuous movement of a fluid like water or air. The word is inflected, meaning its form changes depending on its role in a sentence – for example, 'virtaukset' is the plural form.  The suffix '-us' indicates it’s a noun related to the verb 'virrata' (to flow). It can also refer to a tendency or course of events, like a 'current of thought'. The possessive forms show who owns the flow, for example 'virtaukseni' means 'my flow'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,a as default,t as sentences,e as translation,s as understood};
