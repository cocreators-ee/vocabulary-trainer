It refers to anything related to England, Britain, or the English language and culture. The word is indeclinable in Estonian, meaning it doesn't change form for different cases. It can describe people from England/Britain (though more commonly 'inglane' is used for people), things of English origin, the English language itself ('inglise keel'), or various concepts with 'English' in their name like measurements (inglise nael = pound weight) or styles (Inglise park).",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:i};export{i as context,t as default,e as sentences,n as translation,s as understood};
