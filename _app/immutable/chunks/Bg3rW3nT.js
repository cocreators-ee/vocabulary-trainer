It can refer to both physical parts of plants and animals, as well as components of objects. The word declines based on case, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence. For example, 'varren' is the genitive form meaning 'of the stem/handle/arm', while 'vartta' is the partitive form. It can also be used to indicate location or time along something ('matkan varrella' - along the road).",o={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:t};export{t as context,o as default,a as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
