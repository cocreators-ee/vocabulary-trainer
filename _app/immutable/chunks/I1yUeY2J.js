It is a transitive verb, meaning it requires an object. A key aspect of this word is the directionality – the action implies movement *towards* the speaker or a reference point. This contrasts with 'viedä', which means 'to take away' and indicates movement *away* from the speaker. The word can also mean to supply or contribute, lead, guide, yield, produce, import, etc.",a={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:o};export{o as context,a as default,t as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
