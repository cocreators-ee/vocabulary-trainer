It is larger than 'kukkula' (small hill) but smaller than 'vuori' (mountain). The word declines in various forms depending on its grammatical role in the sentence, as shown in the dictionary definition.  The possessive suffixes indicate who owns or is associated with the hill; for example, 'mäkeni' means 'my hill'.
