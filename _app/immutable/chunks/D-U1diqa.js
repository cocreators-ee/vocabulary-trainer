It can refer to the physical organ, but also figuratively to one’s feelings and emotions. The word declines based on case; for example, 'sydämen' is the genitive form meaning 'of the heart', and 'sydämeen' is the illative form meaning 'into the heart'. It can also be used in possessive forms like 'sydämeni' which means 'my heart'. The dictionary definitions show a wide range of compounds using this word, such as 'reaktorisydän' (reactor core) and 'sydänsairaus' (heart disease).",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,t as understood};
