Primarily, it refers to a person's aunt - either the sister of one's mother or father. Secondarily, in some contexts, it can be used as a general term of address for an older woman similar to 'ma'am'. The word follows specific declension patterns in Estonian grammar and forms compound words with various prefixes indicating different types of 'aunts' (like vanatädi - great aunt) or women in specific roles (like arstitädi - doctor lady).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
