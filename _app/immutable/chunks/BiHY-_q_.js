In grammar, the elative case indicates movement away from something, so 'meestest' specifically means 'from among the men' or 'from among the people'. It's used when indicating selection or origin from a group of males. For example, if you were choosing representatives from a group of men, you might say 'valiti meesmeistest' (chosen from among the men).",m={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:t};export{t as context,m as default,e as sentences,o as translation,s as understood};
