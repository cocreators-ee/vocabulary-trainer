It describes low temperature, either in the weather or when referring to objects. In its basic form it's used for masculine nouns and singular subjects. When modifying feminine nouns or plural forms, it would take different endings (like 'kylmä' for masculine singular, 'kylmät' for plural). It can also be used metaphorically to mean 'unfriendly' or 'heartless'. The word comes from the same Germanic root as English words like 'chill'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,s as default,e as sentences,n as translation,o as understood};
