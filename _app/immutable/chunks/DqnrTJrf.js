In Estonian, 'tema' means 'he/she', and adding '-s' typically indicates a possessive form or case ending. However, based on standard Estonian grammar, 'temas' is not a commonly used word. The more common forms would be 'tema' (he/she) for nominative case, 'temaga' (with him/her) for instrumental case, or 'temal' (on him/her) for locative case.
