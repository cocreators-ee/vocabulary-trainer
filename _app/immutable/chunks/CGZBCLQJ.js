The ending '-id' indicates it's in plural form, and the '-d' at the end shows it's in the partitive case. In Estonian, the partitive case is often used to indicate indefinite objects or what something consists of. So 'uudiseid' can mean 'news (as an object)' or 'some news'. It commonly appears with verbs like 'lugema' (to read) or 'kuulama' (to listen to).",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:t};export{t as context,a as default,e as sentences,s as translation,i as understood};
