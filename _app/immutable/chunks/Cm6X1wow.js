It indicates something that happened right before now or in a time period immediately prior to the current one. In Estonian grammar, the adessive case typically expresses location on or at something, but when combined with temporal words like 'hommikul' (morning), 'päeval' (day), 'nädalal' (week), 'kuul' (month), 'aastal' (year), it functions to indicate the previous time period.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:i};export{i as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
