const i=!0,e=["Lähme siit kuskile veidi kaugemale!","Ta läheb siit kuskile mujale.","Aino on kuskile suvitama sõitnud."],n=["somewhere","to some place","anywhere"],t=`Kuskile is an Estonian adverb that indicates movement to an unspecified or indeterminate location. It's similar to English 'somewhere' but has additional nuances depending on context:

1. In affirmative sentences, it means 'to some place', 'somewhere', or 'to somewhere', referring to a destination that isn't specified or known exactly.
2. In negative sentences, it can mean 'nowhere' or 'not anywhere'.
3. It can sometimes refer to an unspecified time period in the past.

The word is formed by combining 'kuskil' (somewhere) with the illative case suffix '-e', indicating movement toward that location.`,o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,o as default,e as sentences,n as translation,i as understood};
