const t=!0,e=["Kas te olete sellega nõus?","Küsige vanematelt nõu.","Me olime kogu aeg ühes nõus."],o=["agreement","advice","consent","opinion"],n='"Küsige" is the imperative form of the Estonian verb "küsima", which means "to ask". However, based on the dictionary definitions provided, it appears that "küsige" may be referring to "nõu" (advice/opinion) rather than a direct translation of the word itself. The word "küsige" would literally mean "ask" or "inquire", but in context it seems to be connected with seeking advice or opinion. Estonian uses this form when directly addressing someone formally to ask for something, such as asking for advice ("küsi nõu") which would become "küsige nõu" when speaking to multiple people formally.',i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:n};export{n as context,i as default,e as sentences,o as translation,t as understood};
