In the provided examples, it seems to function in contexts where 'art' would be used in English.

The base word 'kunst' means 'art', and '-i' is likely an ending indicating possession (like English "of art" or "in art").`,a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:n};export{n as context,a as default,e as sentences,t as translation,s as understood};
