It is an adjective that describes someone or something having a lot of money, possessions, or valuable qualities. The word declines depending on the case and number (singular/plural). For example, 'rikkaan' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of rich', while 'rikkaat' is the nominative plural form meaning 'rich people'. It can also describe land being fertile or something having a lot of detail - e.g. 'idearikas' means 'full of ideas'.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:i};export{i as context,o as default,e as sentences,a as translation,n as understood};
