First, it acts as an indefinite number meaning 'several' or 'many', referring to countable items but at least more than two. It can be used with nouns (like 'meest' - men) and requires the noun to agree in case. Second, it functions as a question word asking 'how many?' when forming questions about quantity. The word changes form based on case: nominative singular is 'mitu', genitive is 'mitme', partitive is 'mitut', and plural forms include 'mitmed' (nominative) and 'mitmeid' (partitive). It's commonly used in everyday Estonian for both indicating an unspecified number of things and asking about quantities.",a={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:t,context:e};export{e as context,a as default,n as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
