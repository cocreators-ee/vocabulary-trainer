It can describe the quality of something (like work), appearance (like a car), or general impressiveness (like scenery). The word declines based on case and number; for example, 'hienon' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of fine', while 'hienot' is the nominative plural meaning 'fine'. It also has possessive forms to indicate ownership.  The root of the word relates to concepts of being slender or small-grained, but it has evolved to encompass broader notions of quality and beauty.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:n};export{n as context,t as default,e as sentences,o as translation,i as understood};
