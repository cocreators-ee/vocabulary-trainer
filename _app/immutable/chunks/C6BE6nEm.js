It indicates something that is external to boundaries, limits, or the interior space. When used as an adverb, it describes location outside something (e.g., 'The key is outside'). As a preposition with partitive case, it means 'outside of' or 'beyond' something specific (e.g., 'outside the city', 'beyond time and space'). The word contrasts with seespool ('inside').",i={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:e,context:t};export{t as context,i as default,o as sentences,e as translation,s as understood};
