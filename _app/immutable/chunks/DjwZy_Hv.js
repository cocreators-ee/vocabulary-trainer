The elative case indicates movement from out of something or coming from somewhere. So 'puhkust' literally means 'from vacation/holiday' or 'from leave'. It's used when someone has returned from a period of rest, holiday, or time off work. For example: 'Tahan minna puhkust' (I want to go on vacation) uses the partitive case form, while 'Ta tuli puhkust tagasi' (He came back from vacation) would use this elative form.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,a as translation,t as understood};
