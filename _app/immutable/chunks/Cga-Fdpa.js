In this context, it appears to be used as a negative response, similar to saying 'no' or 'not' in English. The dictionary definition shows it being used in dialogue where someone denies lying ('Äkki sa valetad? – „Ei valeta.' meaning 'Maybe you're lying?' – 'No, I'm not lying'). It's part of the broader Estonian negation system and can function as a standalone negative response or be combined with other elements to form more complex negations.",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,a as default,e as sentences,n as translation,o as understood};
