It can mean 'otherwise' or 'in other circumstances' when indicating alternative outcomes (e.g., 'Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late'). It also means 'typically' or 'usually' when describing regular behavior (e.g., 'Normally such a calm person was irritated today'). Additionally, it can express that something happens 'for free' without payment (e.g., 'I wouldn't want this anyway, I'll pay').
