It indicates that someone has the choice to accept or reject something, and there are no other options. This phrase appears in the dictionary examples where Leo is described as being carved from a rock – take it or leave it – and where a picture shows a completely naked person – take it or leave it, just like in a sauna or swimming. The phrase conveys that whatever is presented should be accepted at face value without alteration, and the listener's decision doesn't change its fundamental nature.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,i as default,e as sentences,t as translation,s as understood};
