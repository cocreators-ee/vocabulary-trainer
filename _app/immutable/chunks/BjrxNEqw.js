It has a broad range of meanings, including physical cuts like surgical operations, but also abstract concepts such as reductions in economics or editing in film. The word is derived from the verb 'leikata', meaning 'to cut'.  The noun declines based on case; for example, 'leikkauksen' means 'of the cutting/surgery' (genitive), and 'leikkausta' means 'a cutting/surgery' (partitive). There are also possessive forms like 'leikkaukseni' which means 'my surgery'. The plural form is 'leikkaukset'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:i,context:s};export{s as context,n as default,e as sentences,i as translation,t as understood};
