The inessive case indicates location within or inside something, so 'vennas' would translate to 'in a brother' or 'among brothers', but it's commonly used when talking about being with one's brothers or the concept of brotherhood. In Estonian grammar, nouns have 14 cases, and the -s ending is added to the genitive stem for inessive case formation.",t={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:e,context:s};export{s as context,t as default,n as sentences,e as translation,o as understood};
