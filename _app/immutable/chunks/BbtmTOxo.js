It is used to refer to celestial bodies that appear as points of light in the night sky, similar to how we use 'star' in English. The word can be used in various contexts such as astronomy (täheteleskoop - star telescope), everyday conversation about stars, or metaphorical expressions (näidata tähtedest - show from stars).
