It’s the diminutive form of 'pikkuinen', which itself means small. The suffix '-ruinen' adds emphasis to the smallness, making it even tinier than just 'small'.  It declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition; 'pikkuruiset' is the plural nominative form, for example. It can also be used with possessive suffixes to indicate ownership, like 'pikkuruiseni' (my tiny one).",t={understood:!0,sentences:i,translation:n,context:e};export{e as context,t as default,i as sentences,n as translation,s as understood};
