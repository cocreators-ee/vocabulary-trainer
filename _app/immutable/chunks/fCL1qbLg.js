It describes something that is not visible or cannot be found because it has been deliberately placed out of sight. This form appears to be in the elative case (showing movement from a hidden location) derived from the root word 'peit' which means 'to hide'. In Estonian grammar, the '-dus' suffix often indicates state or condition, suggesting this is describing a state of being hidden.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:i,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,i as translation,s as understood};
