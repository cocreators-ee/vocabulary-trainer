It can be used literally to refer to livestock or cattle (like cows), but it's also commonly used as an insult or swear word to describe someone negatively. The term carries a strong negative emotional connotation when used in this way, similar to calling someone a 'beast' or 'animal' in English. Examples show it being used to describe people who behave like animals - crawling on all fours, eating greedily, or making animal-like sounds.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:s};export{s as context,o as default,e as sentences,a as translation,n as understood};
