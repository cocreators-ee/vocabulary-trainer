First, it literally refers to a yoke for oxen - a wooden beam placed on their heads when pulling loads. Second, it metaphorically means oppression, tyranny, or enslavement - a burdensome and oppressive power or government that controls people like animals in harness. The word is often used in compound words like 'härjaike' (ox-yoke), 'koloniaalike' (colonial yoke/oppression), and 'orjaike' (slave-yoke/bondage).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,o as translation,a as understood};
