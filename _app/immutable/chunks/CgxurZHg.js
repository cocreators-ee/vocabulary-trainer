It can also refer to an ash tree, or metaphorically to a dry elevated area in a swamp/bog. The word has two distinct etymological origins: one related to Proto-Finnic *saari (island) and another related to Proto-Finnic *sarni (ash tree). As 'saar', it's used in the nominative singular form, with 'saared' being the plural form meaning 'islands'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,a as sentences,e as translation,t as understood};
