When used impersonally, it means 'to be needed.' The verb also has specific grammatical constructions such as requiring an allative case marker for indicating payment to someone or using 'eest + genitive' for payment for something. Examples include 'palka maksnud' (paid salary) and 'raamat maksab 80 eurot' (the book costs 80 euros).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:t};export{t as context,s as default,e as sentences,a as translation,o as understood};
