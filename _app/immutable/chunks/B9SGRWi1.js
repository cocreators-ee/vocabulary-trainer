In Estonian, the partitive case is commonly used for mass nouns like food, and it indicates an unspecified amount or partial quantity. The dictionary definition shows that 'söök' can refer to a specific meal (like breakfast, lunch, dinner) or food in general, and 'sööd' would be its partitive form used when referring to some amount of food without specifying the exact quantity.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
