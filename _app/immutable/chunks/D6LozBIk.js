It appears in the phrase 'tegema lõpu (peale)' which means 'to make an end' or 'to conclude'. The Estonian expression can have two main meanings: 1) to kill oneself (when referring to ending one's own life), and 2) to put an end to something, to finish something. This is a common construction in Estonian where the verb 'tegema' (to make/do) is combined with the elative case of 'lõppu' to indicate completion or conclusion.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:o};export{o as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,t as understood};
