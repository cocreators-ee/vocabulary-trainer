It comes from the root word "desimaali" (decimal) and the suffix "-in" which indicates location or position. In mathematics, it specifically means one digit after the decimal point, representing tenths. For example, in the number 3.14, the '1' is in the first desimaalin place (tenths place). The word is commonly used when discussing precision in measurements or calculations.`,a={understood:!0,sentences:i,translation:e,context:t};export{t as context,a as default,i as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
