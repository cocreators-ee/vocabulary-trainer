It primarily means 'lightweight' or 'not heavy' when referring to physical weight, but also extends to mean 'easy,' 'simple,' or 'effortless' when describing tasks or activities. Additionally, it can describe something as not serious or intense (like 'light rain'), comfortable or pleasant ('light breeze'), or even superficial in nature ('a light relationship').
