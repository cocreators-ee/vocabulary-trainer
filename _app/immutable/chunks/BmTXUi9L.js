It's derived from Proto-Finnic and North Germanic languages, similar to Swedish 'jul' and English 'Yule'. The word functions as a plurale tantum noun (only exists in plural form) in Estonian, which is retained from Old Norse. Jõulud encompasses both the religious celebration of Christ's birth on December 25-27 and the traditional winter solstice period from December 21 to January 7.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,o as translation,t as understood};
