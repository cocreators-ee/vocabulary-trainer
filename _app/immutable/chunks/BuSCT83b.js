It originates from Sami languages meaning 'cold mist', but was adopted into Finnish due to phonetic similarity with the Dutch word 'gas'. The word declines based on case; for example, 'kaasun' is the genitive form (of gas), while 'kaasua' is the partitive form (some gas). There are also possessive forms like 'kaasuni' meaning 'my gas', and plural forms such as 'kaasut' which means 'gases'.",t={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:s,context:e};export{e as context,t as default,a as sentences,s as translation,n as understood};
