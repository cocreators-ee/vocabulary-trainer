It can mean physically backwards or reverse direction (like walking backwards), upside down orientation (like an image displayed incorrectly), inside out (clothing worn improperly), or metaphorically decline/regress (things going wrong). The word literally contains 'taga-' meaning back/behind and '-pidi' which often indicates position/direction, so it essentially means 'positioned with the back side forward'.
