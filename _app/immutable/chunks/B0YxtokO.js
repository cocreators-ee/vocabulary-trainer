It's the causative form of 'hävima' (to be destroyed). This word can be used in various contexts - from physical destruction of objects or places (like buildings, evidence, or ecosystems) to more abstract concepts like destroying someone's happiness, freedom, or reputation. The dictionary examples show it being used for both literal destruction (buildings being ruined by war) and figurative destruction (destroying evidence or one's life).",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,a as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
