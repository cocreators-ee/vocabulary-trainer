Based on the context of the dictionary definitions provided, it seems the intended word is likely 'ära', which functions as an adverbial particle meaning 'away' and combines with the verb 'anda' (to give) to form various meanings depending on context: 1) to hand over completely/fully (give away), 2) to betray (by revealing secrets or turning someone in), and 3) to complete/do something (exams, classes). In the phrase 'saladusi ära anda', it would mean 'to reveal secrets' or 'to give away secrets'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,a as translation,o as understood};
