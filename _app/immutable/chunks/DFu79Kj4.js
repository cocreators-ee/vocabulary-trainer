It's often used to describe someone who is attractive but lacks intelligence or common sense, similar to the English concept of an 'airhead' or 'bimbo'. The term carries a somewhat derogatory connotation and is typically applied to girls who are perceived as being more focused on superficial things like material possessions (expensive cars) and wealthy men rather than intellectual pursuits.
