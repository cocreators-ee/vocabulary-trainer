The declension pattern differs between these two meanings - when meaning 'duty', it follows the ÕS type 9/katus pattern (genitive: kohuste), while when meaning 'court', it follows the liige pattern (genitive: kohtu).",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:i};export{i as context,n as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
