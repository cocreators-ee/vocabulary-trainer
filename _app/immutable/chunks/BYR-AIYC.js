It is a title used for unmarried women and can also be a polite form of address, though it’s becoming somewhat dated when addressing waitresses. The word has different forms depending on the grammatical case; for example, 'neidin' is the genitive form, meaning 'of the miss', and 'neitiä' is the partitive form.
