It indicates an effort to do something, often implying that success is not guaranteed. The word breaks down as 'ürita-' (try/attempt) + '-me' (we). In Estonian grammar, this follows a common pattern where the verb stem takes personal endings: üritama (infinitive), üritan (1st person singular - I try), üritad (2nd person singular - you try), üritab (3rd person singular - he/she/it tries), and üritame (1st person plural - we try).",n={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:a};export{a as context,n as default,t as sentences,e as translation,r as understood};
