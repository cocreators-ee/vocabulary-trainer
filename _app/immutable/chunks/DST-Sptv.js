It can be used transitively, indicating creation *from nothing*, or intransitively to mean producing something from existing materials. The form 'loi' is the past tense third-person singular form, as seen in the example sentence 'Alussa loi Jumala taivaan ja maan' (In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth).  The word also has forms for different tenses and persons, such as 'luon' (present tense, first person singular) and 'luovat' (present tense, third-person plural). It can also mean to give birth prematurely when referring to animals.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,o as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
