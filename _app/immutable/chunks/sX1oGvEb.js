Based on the context of the dictionary definitions, it seems to describe a state of being confined, stuck, or required to remain somewhere - like watching TV at home ('Õhtuti sidin kodus ja vahin telekat' means 'In the evening I sat at home and watched TV'). The term appears in contexts where someone is restricted to a particular location, whether voluntarily (watching TV) or involuntarily (being confined somewhere).",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,o as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
