It's used to indicate that something is just short of being complete, achieved, or true. The word combines 'pea' (meaning 'head' but in this context suggesting 'almost') with 'aegu' (related to time). It can be used with quantities ('peaaegu kolm kilogrammi' - almost three kilograms), durations ('peaaegu 40 aastat' - almost 40 years), or with verbs indicating actions that were almost completed but didn't quite happen ('Oleksin peaaegu kukkunud' - I would have almost fallen).",o={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:t};export{t as context,o as default,a as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
