It refers to a person who is owned by another person and forced to work for them. The word has Proto-Finno-Permic roots, potentially borrowed from Proto-Indo-Iranian origins meaning 'Aryan', and cognates exist in Estonian ('ori') and Erzya/Udmurt languages.  The noun declines with different cases indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). The possessive forms show who owns the slave (my slave, your slave, his/her slave).",a={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:o,context:e};export{e as context,a as default,n as sentences,o as translation,t as understood};
