It has three main uses: 1) to indicate something is real/reality-based (not in appearance), as in describing events that actually happened; 2) to emphasize the full extent of something when viewing from a particular perspective; and 3) as an intensifier to strongly emphasize qualities, actions, or states. It comes from the adjective 'tõeline' meaning real/true with the adverbial suffix '-lt'.
