It is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn’t take a direct object. Importantly, it takes the illative case to indicate the destination – answering the question 'where to?' rather than simply 'where?'. The example sentence 'Saavumme kohta Turkuun.' translates to 'We will soon arrive in Turku', where 'Turkuun' is in the illative case indicating arrival *to* Turku.
