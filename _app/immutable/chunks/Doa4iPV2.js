It indicates something located at a lower position than another object, covered by something else, or in the physical space beneath something. For example, 'laua all' means 'under the table', 'auto all' means 'under the car', and 'minu all' means 'below me'. In addition to physical positioning, it can also metaphorically mean being under someone's authority, influence, or control (as in 'sõjaväes tema all' - under him in the army).",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:t};export{t as context,o as default,e as sentences,a as translation,n as understood};
