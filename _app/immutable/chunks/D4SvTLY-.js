Its primary meaning is 'to hear' using the sense of hearing, but it also extends to 'being aware of information,' 'listening to advice or commands,' and functioning as an attention-getter in speech ('Kuule!/Listen!'). The dictionary shows five main categories: physical perception of sounds, becoming informed about something, heeding advice/commands, historical usage (variant form), and as a speech formula. It's important to note that 'kuulma' is the basic verb form, while 'kuulen' indicates first person singular present tense ('I hear').",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
