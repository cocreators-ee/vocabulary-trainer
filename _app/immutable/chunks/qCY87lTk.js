It's used when talking about the act of departing, leaving a place, or saying goodbye. The partitive case often indicates partial action or ongoing process, so 'lahkumist' can refer to the process of departure rather than just the completed action. This form is commonly used in contexts like announcing departures, discussing travel arrangements, or expressing farewell wishes.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,n as default,e as sentences,t as translation,s as understood};
