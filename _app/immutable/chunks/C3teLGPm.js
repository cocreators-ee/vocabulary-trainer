It originates from Swedish and ultimately Middle Low German. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms depending on its grammatical role in a sentence. For example, 'hissin' is the genitive form ('of the elevator'), while 'hissiä' is the partitive form ('some elevator').
