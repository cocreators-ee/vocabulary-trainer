It's a common noun that refers to a building where people live. The word is in the nominative singular form. In different contexts, it can refer to any type of building structure used as living quarters, from small houses to larger buildings. When used with possessive suffixes or in different cases, it changes form (e.g., 'talo' becomes 'talossa' - in the house, 'talon' - of the house).",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:o};export{o as context,t as default,e as sentences,s as translation,n as understood};
