It can mean 'healthy' when referring to people or animals (e.g., 'terve inimene' - healthy person), but also means 'whole', 'entire', or 'complete' when describing objects, periods of time, or quantities (e.g., 'terve päev' - whole day). It can indicate that something is intact and undamaged ('terve maja' - intact house) or natural/normal ('terve mõistus' - sound/common sense). In addition to these literal meanings, 'terve' appears in greetings like 'Olge terveks!' which functions as a well-wishing expression similar to 'Stay healthy!'",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
