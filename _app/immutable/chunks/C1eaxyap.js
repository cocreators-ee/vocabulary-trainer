const n=!0,t=["Astu samm tagasi.","Poiss vaatas tagasi.","Pilet Tartust Tallinna ja tagasi."],a=["back","backward","return","ago"],e=`"Tagasi" is a versatile Estonian adverb with multiple meanings. It primarily means 'back' or 'backward' in terms of direction and movement (e.g., taking a step back, turning your head back). It also indicates return to a starting point or former situation (e.g., coming back from somewhere, going back and forth between places). As a postposition with time expressions, it means 'ago' referring to past events. Additionally, it can indicate retaliation ('in return'), movement toward the past ('back in time'), or restoration to a previous state.`,i={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:a,context:e};export{e as context,i as default,t as sentences,a as translation,n as understood};
