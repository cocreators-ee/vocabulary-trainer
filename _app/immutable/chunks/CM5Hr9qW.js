It's a diminutive form of 'poiss' (boy) and can be used affectionately or sometimes ironically. The word often carries connotations of being charming, small, or young in age. It can refer to both actual children and slightly older males, similar to how we might use 'lad' or 'young fellow' in English.",t={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:n,context:e};export{e as context,t as default,o as sentences,n as translation,i as understood};
