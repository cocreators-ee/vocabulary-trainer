However, based on the dictionary definitions provided for the related verb 'arvama', it appears there might be some confusion in the source data. The word 'käitud' as given would literally mean 'he/she/it goes', but the context and dictionary suggestions point to it being related to 'arvama' (to think/believe). This could potentially be a misspelling or confusion with similar-sounding words, but analyzing 'käitud' directly, it is the present tense conjugation of 'kääma' meaning 'to go/walk/move'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:i};export{i as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
