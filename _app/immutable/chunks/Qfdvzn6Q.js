In this context, it appears to be used as an imperative address, similar to saying 'Listen here!' or 'Pay attention!' in English. It's directed at someone named 'habe' (beard), which could be a literal reference to addressing someone with a beard, or possibly a nickname. The expression suggests asking the person to moderate their speech or tone ('taltsuta oma keelt' - 'tame your tongue').",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
