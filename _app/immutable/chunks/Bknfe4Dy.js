It can also mean the principal amount of a loan or investment. The word is derived from 'pää' (head, top) and 'oma' (one’s own), suggesting something that belongs to someone as their core resource.  The declension shows it changes form depending on its role in a sentence; for example, 'pääoma' is the nominative singular form, while 'pääomat' is the nominative plural. The possessive forms indicate ownership ('pääomani' means 'my capital').",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,o as translation,n as understood};
