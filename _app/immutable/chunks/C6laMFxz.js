Based on the dictionary definition provided, it seems to refer to 'maksumaksjate rühmale maksustamisel tehtav soodustus' (a discount given during taxation for certain groups of taxpayers). The word itself appears to indicate 'for some' or 'to certain ones' in context, suggesting it's a form that indicates direction or benefit toward specific recipients. In Estonian grammar, this likely represents the adessive case plural of 'mõni' (some), indicating that something is being done for or to certain unspecified entities.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,i as default,e as sentences,t as translation,s as understood};
