It refers to the lower limb of humans and animals. In addition to its literal meaning, it's also used in various idiomatic expressions like 'elama heal jalal' (to live well), which metaphorically means being on a solid foundation. The word has multiple grammatical forms including genitive 'jala', partitive 'jalga', and plural form 'jalad'. It can also refer to the supporting leg/base of furniture or objects, and historically it was used as a unit of measurement (about 30 cm).",i={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:t};export{t as context,i as default,a as sentences,e as translation,o as understood};
