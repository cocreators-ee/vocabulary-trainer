In Estonian, numerals can change their ending depending on grammatical case. The partitive case is often used with numbers when they indicate an unspecified quantity or are followed by a noun in the genitive case. For example, 'tuhande inimese' means 'of thousands of people' or 'thousands of people', where 'inimeste' is the genitive plural of 'inimene' (person).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,s as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
