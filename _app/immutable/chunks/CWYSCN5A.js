In Estonian, the elative case indicates movement or origin away from something. So 'esimestest' would mean 'from the first (day/month)' and typically refers to a starting point in time, often used with months or days to indicate when something begins. For example: 'alates esimesest jaanuarist' means 'starting from January 1st'.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
