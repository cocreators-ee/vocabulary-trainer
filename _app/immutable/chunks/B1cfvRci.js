The illative case in Estonian indicates movement into or towards a place. So 'tuppa' specifically means 'into the room' and is used when someone or something enters a space. It's formed by adding the illative ending '-a' to the stem of the word 'tuba'. This form would be used after verbs indicating movement like 'minema' (to go) or 'võtma' (to take).",n={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:o};export{o as context,n as default,t as sentences,e as translation,a as understood};
