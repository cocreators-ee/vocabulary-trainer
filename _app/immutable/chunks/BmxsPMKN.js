It's used to indicate something happening at a time prior to another event. The word often appears in constructions comparing two time points, such as 'ennem...kui...' (before...than...). In the examples provided, it shows usage in various contexts: 1) indicating a general preference for morning over evening; 2) suggesting coming earlier than planned due to a deadline; and 3) expressing that more work needs to be done before being ready.
