The dictionary entries refer to 'koduhoidja', which means 'house sitter' or someone who watches over home/pets in absence. Since the word given is 'vaatab' and not 'koduhoidja', I need to analyze it as a form of 'vaatama'. 'Vaatab' is 3rd person singular present tense, meaning 'he/she/it watches' or 'he/she/it looks at'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:a};export{a as context,n as default,e as sentences,o as translation,t as understood};
