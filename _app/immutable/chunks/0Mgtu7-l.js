It refers to the cotton plant itself, or the raw material derived from it. The word originates from a combination of 'puu' (tree) and 'villa' (wool), calqued from German 'Baumwolle' ('tree-wool').  The word declines based on case; for example, 'puuvillaa' is the partitive singular form meaning 'some cotton', while 'puuvillat' is the nominative plural form meaning 'cottons'. Possessive forms also exist to indicate ownership (e.g., 'puuvillani' - my cotton).",a={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:t,context:e};export{e as context,a as default,o as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
