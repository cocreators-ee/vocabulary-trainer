It's commonly used in negative sentences to express that something will never happen, has never happened, or under no circumstances. The dictionary shows it can also appear with the suffix '-gi' as 'iialgi' (meaning 'also never') and is sometimes used interchangeably with 'kunagi' (ever). In positive contexts, it can emphasize 'at any time' or 'under any circumstances'.
