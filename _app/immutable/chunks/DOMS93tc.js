This makes it somewhat similar to Finnish 'lounas', though their meanings differ slightly - Estonian 'lõuna' doesn't include southwest like Finnish does. The word can be declined in various cases depending on its usage: nominative lõuna, genitive lõunate, partitive lõunat, illative lõunasse, etc.",s={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:t,context:e};export{e as context,s as default,n as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
