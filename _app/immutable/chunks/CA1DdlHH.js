It can refer to a physical gate or door, but also has meanings related to entry points in computing and networking (like a port on a computer), as well as metaphorical uses like an entryway or portal. The word declines based on case; for example, 'portin' is the genitive form meaning 'of the gate', while 'porttiin' indicates movement towards the gate ('to the gate'). It can also be used to indicate possession, such as 'porttini' which means 'my gate'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:o};export{o as context,a as default,t as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
