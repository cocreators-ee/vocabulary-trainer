It indicates repeated, habitual action rather than a one-time event. Unlike the simple verb 'minema' (to go), which suggests movement from A to B without return, 'käima' implies going somewhere and typically coming back, often for a short duration or specific purpose. The verb is commonly used with the illative case (-sse) to indicate destination, such as 'käida poes' (go to the store).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
