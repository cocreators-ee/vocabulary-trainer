It refers to a barren area of land, typically with little water or vegetation. The word is derived from 'aava', meaning 'open, wide', and was coined by Daniel Europaeus in 1853.  It declines according to the Kotus type 4*A/laatikko pattern, showing different forms depending on grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) and number (singular or plural). The possessive forms also change based on who owns the desert. There are many compound words using 'aavikko', such as 'aavikkoalue' (desert area) and 'hiekka-aavikko' (sand desert).",t={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,t as default,a as sentences,e as translation,i as understood};
