The partitive case in Estonian typically indicates an incomplete or indefinite quantity, so "mehi" would translate to "some men" or "men" when referring to a group without specifying the exact number. It's commonly used when talking about men in general, or an unspecified number of men.`,o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,o as default,e as sentences,n as translation,i as understood};
