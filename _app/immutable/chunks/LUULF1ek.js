It can refer to physical paint, as in the substance used for coloring surfaces. It also means a goal or target, both literally (like in sports) and figuratively (an aim or objective). The word declines based on case, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence. For example, 'maalin' is the genitive form meaning 'of the paint/goal', while 'maaliin' indicates movement towards a goal ('to the goal').",n={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:i,context:e};export{e as context,n as default,a as sentences,i as translation,t as understood};
