In Estonian, nouns change their endings depending on case and number. The partitive case indicates that something is being seen or experienced partially. So 'silmi' typically appears in contexts where someone is looking at eyes, mentioning eyes, or referring to sight. For example, 'Ta vaatab silmi' means 'He/She looks into the eyes', 'Lapsed m채ngivad silmi' means 'Children are playing with their eyes/peek-a-boo', and 'Ma n채gin tema silmis' means 'I saw in his/her eyes'.
