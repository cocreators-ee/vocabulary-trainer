It emphasizes that something is happening or exists precisely at the location where the speaker currently is. The word combines 'siin' (here) with 'samas' (same/the same), creating a stronger emphasis on immediacy and proximity. It can also sometimes indicate 'very soon' or 'at that very moment' in temporal contexts, similar to 'nüüdsama'. Examples show its usage for physical location ('Oota mind siinsamas' - Wait for me here) as well as for emphasis when describing events happening close by.",t={understood:!0,sentences:s,translation:e,context:a};export{a as context,t as default,s as sentences,e as translation,i as understood};
