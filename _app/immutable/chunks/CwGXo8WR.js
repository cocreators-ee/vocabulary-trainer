Based on the dictionary definitions, 'ega' has multiple meanings: 1) it connects repeated elements in negative sentences meaning 'no also' or 'not either'; 2) it can mean 'and not' when connecting predicates; and 3) it appears as a negation at the beginning of sentences meaning something like 'of course not'. The word 'vastust' seems to be part of this same pattern, likely being an accusative singular form that connects with previous elements in a negative context.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,s as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
