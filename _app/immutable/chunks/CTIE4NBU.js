It can refer to any substance consumed by living organisms, a prepared meal, or a specific dish. The word has two common declension patterns, but both are considered acceptable.  It comes from Proto-Finnic *rooka and is related to words for care and attention in Germanic languages. You'll see it inflected in various cases like nominative (ruoka), genitive (ruoan/ruuan), partitive (ruokaa), and illative (ruokaan). The possessive forms also change depending on who owns the food, such as 'ruokani' for my food.",s={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:o,context:e};export{e as context,s as default,a as sentences,o as translation,n as understood};
