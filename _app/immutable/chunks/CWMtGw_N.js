It describes things that pose a threat, risk, or potential harm to people or property. The '-d' ending indicates it's in plural form, and since there's no genitive case marker like '-de' or '-da', this appears to be the nominative plural case used when the dangerous things are the subject of the sentence.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
