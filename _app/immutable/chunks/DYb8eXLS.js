It can be used in both singular and plural forms (mure/mured). The word often conveys a sense of personal or emotional burden - something that troubles the mind or causes distress. While it generally carries negative connotations like 'worry' or 'anxiety', it can sometimes refer to more neutral concerns or responsibilities, similar to how English uses 'care'. In Estonian, one might speak about having 'mure südamel' (worries on their heart) or carrying their mured alone. The plural form 'mured' often refers to multiple worries or concerns that someone is dealing with.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:r,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,r as translation,n as understood};
