It is a noun that refers to the rigid structural elements in a skeleton, or the material making up those bones. The word declines based on case; for example, 'luun' is the genitive form meaning 'of the bone', and 'luihin' is the illative form meaning 'into the bones'. There are also possessive forms indicating who owns the bone, like 'luuni' (my bone) or 'luumme' (our bone).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,s as default,e as sentences,n as translation,o as understood};
