It declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. The ending changes to reflect grammatical roles like nominative, genitive, partitive, etc., and whether it refers to a singular or plural subject. For example, 'oudon' is the genitive singular form, meaning 'of strange', while 'outoja' is the partitive plural form, meaning 'some strange things'. The suffix '-i' often indicates possession, as in 'outosi' which means 'your strange'.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,o as default,e as sentences,n as translation,i as understood};
