It can also refer more broadly to a farm or homestead, and even a company or workplace in certain contexts. The word declines based on case (nominative, genitive, etc.), and possessive suffixes are added to indicate ownership ('my house', 'your house' and so on).  The plural form is 'talot'. For example, 'talon' means 'of the house', while 'taloa' means 'some house'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,o as translation,n as understood};
