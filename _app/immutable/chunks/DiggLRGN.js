It functions as an imperative command telling a group including the speaker not to do something. The word combines the negative prefix 'är-' with the plural ending '-me', creating a 'let's not' or 'don't (we)' construction. This is used when the speaker includes themselves in the prohibition, equivalent to saying 'Let's not...' or 'We must not...'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
