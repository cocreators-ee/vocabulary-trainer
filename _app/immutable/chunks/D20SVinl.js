However, in the provided dictionary definitions and context, it appears that there might be some confusion as the main definition given is for the verb 'kohtama' (to meet). Looking at the example sentence 'Metsavahelisel teel kohtas 'võis' kohata harva inimesi', it seems 'võis' here is being used to mean something like 'one could encounter' or 'it was possible to encounter'. The word can also be related to 'kohtama' (to meet) and suggests possibility of encountering people.",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,a as default,e as sentences,t as translation,s as understood};
