It functions as a possessive pronoun, similar to 'my' or 'mine' in English. The '-ni' suffix indicates possession ('my'). It can also be used as an accusative singular in some dialects, but this usage is dated and less common. In the examples provided, it shows possession (My mother), ownership (This book is mine) and necessity (I have to do this now).",o={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:s,context:i};export{i as context,o as default,n as sentences,s as translation,e as understood};
