It's used to emphasize the degree or truthfulness of a statement, similar to how we might use words like 'very' or 'really' in English but with stronger emphasis. The word is formed from 'tõde' (truth) plus '-ie-' suffix and '-ga' which often indicates accompaniment or means 'with', so literally something like 'with truth'.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,i as default,e as sentences,t as translation,s as understood};
