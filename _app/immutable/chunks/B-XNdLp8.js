In Estonian, adjectives change their endings depending on the case they're in. The partitive case often indicates incomplete action or indefinite quantity. So 'häid' would typically be used after certain verbs or in specific grammatical contexts where the partitive case is required. It's essentially saying 'some good' or 'good (in partitive form)'. Examples include common greetings like 'Head aega!' (Have a good time!), 'Tere hommikust, head päeva!' (Good morning, have a good day!), and 'Head ööd!' (Good night!).",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:i};export{i as context,o as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
