First, it can mean 'without mentioning' or 'not to mention', used when something so obvious is excluded from discussion that it doesn't need to be mentioned (similar to English 'let alone'). Second, in older usage, it means 'extremely' or 'very intensively'. It can also function as an indeclinable adjective meaning 'unspeakable' or 'indescribable'. The word is formed from 'rääkima' (to speak) with the negative suffix '-ta', literally meaning 'without speaking'.",i={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,i as default,t as sentences,e as translation,a as understood};
