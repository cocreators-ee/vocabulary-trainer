It is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn’t take a direct object. The dictionary definitions show that the verb can be conjugated in various tenses and moods, including present, past, conditional, and imperative.  It's important to note that there are two ways to express 'begin to do' - with the first infinitive ('alkaa tehdä') or the illative of the third infinitive ('alkaa tekemään'), both being accepted as standard forms now. The word does not exhibit final gemination in its third-person singular indicative form, unlike the lemma form.",a={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,a as default,t as sentences,e as translation,i as understood};
