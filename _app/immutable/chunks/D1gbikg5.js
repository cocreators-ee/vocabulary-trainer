It's considered quite offensive and informal. In example sentences, it can be used to describe someone as unpleasant (e.g., 'He is such a jerk'), express frustration with someone's behavior (e.g., 'Why are you being such an idiot?'), or describe a difficult situation (e.g., 'It was a really shitty day').",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,s as translation,o as understood};
