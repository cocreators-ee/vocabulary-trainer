It also has a secondary meaning as a girder or beam – a load-bearing horizontal support in a building. The word declines based on case; for example, 'niskan' is the genitive form (of the neck), and 'niskaa' is the partitive form.  The plural forms are 'niskat', with corresponding changes to other cases like 'niskojen' (genitive plural). Possessive suffixes also exist, such as 'niskani' meaning 'my neck'. The word can be used in various contexts, from describing physical discomfort ('hieroi niskansa' - rubbed his/her neck) to structural elements of buildings.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
