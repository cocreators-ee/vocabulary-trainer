It can describe physical positioning (askew, crooked, slanted), directional deviation (off course, not straight), or improper execution (wrongly, badly). It's commonly used to indicate something is not in its proper position or orientation - whether it's objects tilted at an angle, people going off track, or things being done incorrectly.
