Based on the dictionary definition, it's primarily used as a command encouraging action - either urging someone to go forward (like 'las käia!' - let it go!, 'anna minna!' - let them go!, or 'läki!' - go!). It can also be used with an excited tone ('kähku!'). When accompanied by waving hand motions, it means goodbye ('hüvasti!'). In the examples provided, it's used to encourage someone to put on new clothes and go to a party, jump on a train and head for Riga, start the car and drive out of town, or to tell boys to go catch fish. It can also be said when waving goodbye to mother.",n={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:o,context:e};export{e as context,n as default,a as sentences,o as translation,t as understood};
