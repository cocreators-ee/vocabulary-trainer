The word originates from a Savonian dialectal term meaning 'line, queue', and was coined as the modern sense of 'train' in 1864.  It declines based on case; for example, 'junan' means 'of the train' (genitive), while 'junaa' is used when referring to the train as an object ('the train').",s={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:e,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,n as sentences,e as translation,t as understood};
