It is a noun referring to the large, clumsy brown to black long-haired predatory mammal (Ursus arctos), also known as brown bear. The word can be used literally to refer to the animal itself or metaphorically to describe someone who is strong like a bear or clumsy/not very clever. In compound words, it appears as a second element in various species names (like jääkaru for polar bear) and can also be used as a suffix-like element to describe people with bear-like qualities.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:o};export{o as context,n as default,e as sentences,a as translation,r as understood};
