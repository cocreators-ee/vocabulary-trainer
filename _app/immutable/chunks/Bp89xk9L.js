It means 'with hands' or 'with a hand'. In this context, it's used as part of the phrase 'lahtise käega' which translates to 'with an open hand'. This expression has several meanings: 1) being generous or liberal with giving; 2) skilled at doing something particular (like work); and 3) in some contexts, it can mean hitting lightly. The word shows how Estonian uses case endings to indicate the instrument or means by which something is done - here indicating that the action is performed using hands.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
