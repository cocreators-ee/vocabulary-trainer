Looking at the dictionary definitions provided, it seems this might be related to or used with the word 'kord', which means 'once' or 'sometime'. The context shows that when combined with 'kordki', it forms expressions like 'tell the truth once' or 'say something truthful'. However, based on the available data and dictionary definitions specifically for 'ütleksid', I can see this is likely a conditional form of the verb meaning 'would you say/tell'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
