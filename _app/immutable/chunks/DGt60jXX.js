It's used when someone wants to express complete agreement or unquestioning acceptance of what another person says or does. The phrase suggests an enthusiastic, almost religious level of endorsement, where the speaker agrees so completely they might as well be saying "yes" and offering a prayer-like "amen." This expression is often used humorously or ironically to indicate that someone always agrees with authority figures or particular viewpoints without question.`,n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:s};export{s as context,n as default,e as sentences,a as translation,t as understood};
