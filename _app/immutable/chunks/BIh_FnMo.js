As a diminutive ending '-ke' is added, it suggests something small-scale but still has that quality of strangeness or peculiarity. It's often used to describe places or things that are unusual in some way, often with a slightly positive or neutral connotation rather than negative. The word can be translated as 'strange place', 'odd place' or 'peculiar location'. It typically refers to small-scale strange phenomena or locations rather than massive or serious oddities.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
