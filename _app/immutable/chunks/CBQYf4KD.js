In Estonian, adjectives change their endings based on case and number. The partitive case is used to indicate partialness or indefiniteness. So 'uut' means 'a little bit of new' or 'some new'. It's commonly used with nouns in the partitive case to express that you have some amount of something new. For example, 'Tule uut juustu osta!' means 'Come buy some new cheese!'",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:s};export{s as context,o as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
