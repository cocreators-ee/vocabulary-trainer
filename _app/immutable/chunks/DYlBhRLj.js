It can refer to animal fats, oily substances, or even creams and lotions used for skin care. The word declines based on case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) and number (singular/plural), as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'rasva' is the nominative singular form meaning 'fat', while 'rasvat' is the nominative plural form meaning 'fats'. Possessive forms also exist to indicate ownership ('my fat' would be 'rasvani').",i={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:n,context:e};export{e as context,i as default,a as sentences,n as translation,s as understood};
