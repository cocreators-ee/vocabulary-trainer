It can appear in several forms: as the base form "oma," as "omad" (plural), and as "omale" (allative case). The word indicates possession, relationship to oneself, or belonging to someone/something specific. For example: 1) As a possessive pronoun replacing repeated nouns ("Peetri nägu on mustem kui Jaani oma" = Peter's face is darker than John's own), 2) After genitive attributes to avoid repetition ("Raamat on poisi oma" = The book is the boy's own), and 3) As a reflexive pronoun with verbs ("Ta ostab omale kingad" = He buys shoes for himself).`,n={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:e,context:a};export{a as context,n as default,o as sentences,e as translation,s as understood};
