It can also refer to platforms used for various activities like chess (šakkilauta - chessboard), ironing (silityslauta - ironing board) or surfing (laine lauta - surf board). The word has different forms depending on the case; 'laudat' is the plural form, meaning boards. There are also more specific terms to describe the size of a board: anything narrower than 75mm is called 'rima', and thicker pieces are known as 'lankku' or 'parru'.",r={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,r as default,a as sentences,e as translation,o as understood};
