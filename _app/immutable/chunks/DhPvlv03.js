It can function in several ways: 1) As a direct interrogative word asking about reasons or causes (e.g., 'Miks sa kiirustad?' - Why are you hurrying?), 2) In relative clauses after commas to introduce explanations of reasons (e.g., 'Peeter teab, miks maakera pöörleb' - Peeter knows why the Earth spins), and 3) In rhetorical questions expressing regret or reproach. It can also appear with negative verbs to express agreement or possibility (e.g., 'Miks mitte võtta' - Why not take it). Additionally, 'miks' has a secondary meaning as a noun referring to 'the question why', and in modern musical contexts, it can mean 'mix' from English.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,a as translation,s as understood};
