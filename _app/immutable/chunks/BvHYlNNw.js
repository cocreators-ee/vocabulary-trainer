In Estonian, the genitive case typically indicates possession or origin. So 'alguse' can mean 'of the beginning' or 'from the start'. It's often used when talking about something that starts or originates from a particular point. For example, '_alguse panek_' means 'making a start' or 'beginning the process', while '_algusse jõudmine_' would mean 'reaching the beginning'.
