const o=!0,e=["Kus sa elad?","Kus me kokku saame?","Kus Madis on?"],s=["where","in which place"],t="The Estonian word 'kus' is an interrogative and relative adverb meaning 'where' or 'in which place'. It's used to ask about location and to introduce relative clauses about places. In questions, it asks where someone or something is located (Kus sa elad? - Where do you live?). As a relative pronoun, it introduces clauses describing locations (See on koht, kus me kohtume - This is the place where we meet). It can also be used to introduce subordinate clauses indicating time when something happens (Kell 15:00, kus me kohtume - At 3:00 PM, when we meet), though in this usage it's more commonly replaced by 'mil' for precise times. Additionally, 'kus' is used in various idiomatic expressions and can serve as an intensifier at the beginning of sentences to express surprise or emphasis (Kus oli pidu! - Where was the party!/What a party!).",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:t};export{t as context,i as default,e as sentences,s as translation,o as understood};
