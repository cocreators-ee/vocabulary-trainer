It can mean eternal or everlasting when referring to things that last forever (like truth, fire, or material). When describing something that happens repeatedly without stopping, it means constant or continuous (like quarrels or noise). In emotional speech, it's used as an intensifier meaning 'what a...' or 'a real' person/thing (often with negative connotations like calling someone a layabout).
