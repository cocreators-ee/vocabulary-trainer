It can be used for both male and female actors/actresses. The word comes from the verb 'näidata' meaning 'to show' or 'to act', combined with the suffix '-ja' which indicates an agent or doer of an action. In Estonian, this is a gender-neutral term that doesn't distinguish between actor and actress - both are referred to as näitleja.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,o as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
