In Estonian, nouns have different cases depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The partitive case (ending -a/-ä) is used to indicate partialness, indefiniteness, or object status. So 'palka' typically appears as the direct object of verbs related to receiving payment, or when talking about salary in an indefinite sense. For example: 'saan palka' means 'I receive salary/wages', and 'suur palka' means 'big salary'. The basic form (nominative) is 'palk', but in contexts where it's the object being discussed, the partitive form 'palka' is commonly used.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,a as translation,t as understood};
