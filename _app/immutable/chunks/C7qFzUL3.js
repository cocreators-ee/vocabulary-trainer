Most commonly it refers to a family or household group of people living together under one roof. It can also specifically mean a farm with its inhabitants, used historically when contrasting with the farm workers ('pererahvas'). The word extends to groups united by common interests (like theater troupe), families of animals, and even colonies of bees in a hive. Like many Estonian nouns, it declines regularly with partitive 'peret' and illative 'perre'.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,i as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
