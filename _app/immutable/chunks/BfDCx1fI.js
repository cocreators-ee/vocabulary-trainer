As a genitive form, it indicates possession or relationship - so 'joogi' specifically means 'of a drink' or 'belonging to a drink'. However, based on the dictionary definition that mentions 'filos joogat rakendav isik' (a person who applies philosophy), and given its structure as a genitive form ending in '-i', it can also be interpreted as meaning 'of a drinker' - referring to someone associated with drinking or beverages. This form would typically modify another noun, such as 'joogi olemus' (the nature of a drink) or could be used adjectivally.",s={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:e,context:i};export{i as context,s as default,o as sentences,e as translation,n as understood};
