As the partitive singular form of 'pask', it can refer to animal feces or excrement (e.g., horses have dropped their paska). It also means mud or mire, especially when describing wet ground conditions. In informal speech, it's used as a vulgar term for nonsense, rubbish, or crap. The word appears in compound forms like 'kanapask' and 'lehmapask'. Due to its vulgar nature, it should be used with caution.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:a};export{a as context,t as default,e as sentences,s as translation,n as understood};
