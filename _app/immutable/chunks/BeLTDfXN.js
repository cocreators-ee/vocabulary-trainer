However, it also has vulgar meanings referring to male genitalia – specifically 'penis' or 'testicles'. It can even colloquially refer to 'guts' or 'courage', as in the phrase 'Onko sulla munaa tehdä se?' which translates to 'Do you have the balls to do it?'. The word declines based on grammatical case, with different forms for singular and plural. For example, 'munan' is the genitive singular form, while 'munia' is the partitive plural.",i={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,i as default,a as sentences,e as translation,s as understood};
