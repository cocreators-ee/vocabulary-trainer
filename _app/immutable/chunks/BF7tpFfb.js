As an adverb, it means 'twice' or 'in a double manner', indicating repetition or doubling of something. As an adjective (which is indeclinable in this form), it means 'double' or 'twofold'. It can refer to physical size, quantity, price, time duration, or abstract concepts like responsibilities. The word originates from German 'doppelt' and Middle Low German 'dubbelt'. In common usage, it's often used with measurements (like rooms being double the size), prices (paying double), quantities (double portions of coffee), or even to express that something is done twice instead of not at all.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,n as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
