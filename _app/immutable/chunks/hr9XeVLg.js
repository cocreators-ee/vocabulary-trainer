It can function both as an adverb (when describing how something is done) and as an adjective (describing something that belongs to someone specifically). The word combines 'oma' (one's own) with 'ette' (separately/in front), literally suggesting 'in one's own separate way'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:n};export{n as context,a as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
