In Estonian, nouns change their endings to indicate different grammatical cases. The partitive case ('-i' ending) typically indicates an incomplete action or what someone has/doesn't have. So 'numbri' would be used when you're talking about having a number, needing a number, or seeing a number (rather than the complete number itself).",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
