It can refer to a jealous husband, as shown in the dictionary example 'Otse haiglaselt, väiklaselt armukade abielumees.' The word comes from 'armu' (love/mercy) and 'kade' (jealous), suggesting someone who is protective or possessive out of love. It's commonly used to describe possessive behavior in relationships, warning signs like 'Ära armukadedaks mine!' (Don't become jealous!) or attempts to provoke jealousy with 'Tahtsin naist armukadedaks teha.' (I wanted to make the woman jealous).",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:s};export{s as context,t as default,e as sentences,a as translation,o as understood};
