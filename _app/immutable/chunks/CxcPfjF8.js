const t=!0,e=["Mul vedas väga","Temal on hea õnn","Õnne korral saame seal öömaja"],s=["luck","fortune","happiness","success","good fortune"],o=`"Vedanud" is the past participle form of the Estonian verb "vedama," which means to pull or drag. However, in this context, it's used in an idiomatic expression where "mul vedas väga" (literally "it pulled me a lot") actually means "I had great luck" or "things went very well for me." This usage is common in Estonian to express good fortune or favorable circumstances. The word appears in expressions about luck and success, similar to English phrases like "I was lucky" or "things worked out well. It's often used with reflexive pronouns (mul, sul) and indicates that someone had positive outcomes due to chance rather than effort.`,a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:o};export{o as context,a as default,e as sentences,s as translation,t as understood};
