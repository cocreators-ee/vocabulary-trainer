It can describe accumulations of various materials like leaves, sand, books, records, etc. The term is commonly used for both organized piles (like a stack of books) and random collections (like a pile of fallen leaves). It's often used with specific modifiers to indicate what kind of pile it is (e.g., 'liivahunnik' - sand pile, 'puuhunnik' - wood pile).",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:i,context:n};export{n as context,o as default,e as sentences,i as translation,a as understood};
