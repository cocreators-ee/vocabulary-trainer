It's the singular nominative form of the adjective. The base stem appears to be 'õnne-' with the suffix '-tu', which in Estonian typically forms adjectives describing a state or condition. When used for masculine subjects (like 'mees' - man), it remains 'õnnetu'. For feminine subjects, it would become 'õnnetud'.
