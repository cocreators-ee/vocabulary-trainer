As a numeral, it means 'four'. However, when used adverbially (especially referring to horse gait), it means 'in gallop' - describing how something is done or moved quickly and energetically. In the example sentences, we see it used both as indicating speed ('Hobune jookseb nelja' - The horse runs in gallop) and as part of compound expressions like 'tuhatnelja' (four thousand).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,n as translation,o as understood};
