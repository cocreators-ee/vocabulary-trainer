It's used in Estonian when referring to an unspecified quantity of something, similar to how we use 'some' or 'any' in English. The partitive case in Estonian often indicates partialness or indefiniteness. In these examples, it's modifying plural nouns like 'tooteid' (products), 'postimeest' (mailmen/postmen), and 'haigusi' (illnesses).",t={understood:!0,sentences:i,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,t as default,i as sentences,e as translation,s as understood};
