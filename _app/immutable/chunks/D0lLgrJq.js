It is an adjective that indicates something comes before all others in a sequence or order. In Estonian grammar, adjectives need to agree with the noun they modify in case and number - for example, if referring to a feminine subject in the nominative case, it would be 'esimene naine' (first woman), but if referring to multiple people or objects, the plural form would be used.
