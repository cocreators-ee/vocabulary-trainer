It originates from Proto-Finnic *vaimo, which originally meant 'spirit, soul'. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'vaimon' is the genitive form meaning 'of a wife', and 'vaimolle' is the dative form meaning 'to a wife'. It can also refer to a woman generally, especially an elderly one, though this usage is archaic. The possessive forms indicate who the wife belongs to; for example, 'vaimoni' means 'my wife'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:i,context:o};export{o as context,a as default,e as sentences,i as translation,n as understood};
