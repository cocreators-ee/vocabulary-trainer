It's derived from Middle Low German 'busse'. The word follows specific declension patterns in Estonian with the genitive form being 'püssi' and partitive 'püssi'. In addition to its literal meaning of a firearm, it can also be used figuratively to describe something as 'sharp', 'intense', or 'fierce' (as in 'naine on tal äge, lausa päris püss' - the woman is sharp, almost like a real gun).",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:i};export{i as context,t as default,e as sentences,s as translation,a as understood};
