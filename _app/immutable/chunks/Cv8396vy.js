However, based on the dictionary definitions provided which show extensive entries for 'kokku' (not 'kontakti'), it seems there may be some confusion. The dictionary primarily covers 'kokku' with multiple meanings: 1) in total/together as sum, 2) gathering people/things together, 3) physical contact/collision, 4) joining/combining into a whole, 5) becoming dirty/messy, 6) folding/compressing to take less space, 7) collapsing/failing, 8) reaching agreement, 9) being in harmony/agreement, and 10) as part of compound verbs indicating vague or messy results. Since the specific word analyzed is 'kontakti', it most likely refers to contact with someone/something, but could also be a misspelling of 'kokku' which has extensive definitions provided.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,o as translation,i as understood};
