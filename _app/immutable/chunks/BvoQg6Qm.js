It comes from Biblical Hebrew meaning 'certainly, truly.' In religious contexts, it marks the end of a prayer or church service (e.g., after the teacher's prayer). In secular usage, it signifies that something has been decisively decided with no further discussion needed - like saying 'case closed' or 'that's final'. The word carries both formal (religious) and informal (everyday) connotations in Estonian.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,a as translation,t as understood};
