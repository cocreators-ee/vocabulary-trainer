It functions as a possessive pronoun indicating ownership. The '-nsa/-nsä' suffix denotes possession and attaches to the personal pronoun 'hän' (he/she). As indicated by the dictionary definition, it can also be used in older dialects as an accusative singular form of 'hän', but this usage is dated. In modern spoken Finnish, the possessive suffix '-nsa/-nsä' is often omitted.",t={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:s,context:e};export{e as context,t as default,n as sentences,s as translation,i as understood};
