In the first dictionary definition, it appears to be used as a reference to hops (humal), but this seems to be an error based on the Wiktionary entry showing it's actually the genitive case of 'beer'. As the genitive singular, it would typically indicate possession or relationship to beer - for example, 'of beer' or related to beer.
