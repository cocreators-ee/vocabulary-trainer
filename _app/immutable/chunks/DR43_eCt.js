It refers to a generally flat covering over something like a jar or box (lid/cover), the front and back of a book or magazine (cover), or the floor-like covering on a ship (deck). The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'kannen' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of the lid', and 'kansia' is the partitive plural form meaning 'some lids'.
