It has no nominative form (the nominative is usually replaced by 'ise'). The word serves to extend verbs, referring back to the subject of an action. For example, it can be used as an object ('kammib ennast' - combs oneself), adverbially ('hindab end üle' - evaluates oneself excessively), or as a possessive attribute replacing 'oma' ('enda nime all välja' - under one's own name). The declension forms include genitive 'enese', partitive 'ennast', illative 'enesesse', etc., and some singular forms can also be used in plural.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:s};export{s as context,o as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
