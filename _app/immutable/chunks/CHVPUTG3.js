First, as a noun it means 'small boat, cut out of a tree trunk'. Second, and more commonly, as an adjective it means 'Russian' - something related to Russia or Russian culture. This includes referring to the Russian language (vene keel), Russian people (venelased), Russian traditions, etc. The word is indeclinable when used as an adjective meaning 'Russian', but has full declension patterns when used as a noun meaning 'boat'. Many compound words use this element to indicate Russian origin or characteristics.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:s};export{s as context,t as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
