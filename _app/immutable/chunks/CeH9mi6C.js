It means 'some', 'some kind of', or 'a certain'. It's used when referring to something that is not specifically identified, defined, or precisely known. In affirmative sentences, it introduces an unspecified element (like 'Mingi suur elukas' - Some large animal), while in negative sentences it makes the negation more categorical (like 'Tal pole sellest mingit aimu' - He has no idea about this). The word can also be used colloquially as an adverb meaning 'about' or 'approximately'.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:i};export{i as context,t as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
