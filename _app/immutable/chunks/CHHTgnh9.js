It is a noun that declines based on case and number. The dictionary definitions show it can also refer to war (historical contexts like 'isoviha', meaning the Great Wrath), but this usage is less common now.  The partitive form ('vihaa') is often used when expressing anger *towards* something, using the preposition 'kohtaan'.
