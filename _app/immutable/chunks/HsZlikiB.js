However, based on the context and dictionary definitions provided, it seems there might be confusion. The dictionary shows 'tagasi ajama' meaning 'to drive back/send back', and includes example sentences where someone 'ajab tagasi'. The word 'teame' could be related to this construction meaning something like 'we know' or it might be part of a phrase like 'me teame kõik' meaning 'we know everything'.
