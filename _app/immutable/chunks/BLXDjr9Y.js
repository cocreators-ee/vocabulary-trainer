It can refer to a mistake or error (failure to comply with rules, norms, standards), a flaw or defect in something being out of order, a physical injury or malaise, or a deficiency/lack that prevents perfection. The word changes form depending on case and number - its genitive is 'vea', partitive is 'viga', plural nominative is 'vead'. It's commonly used in expressions like 'mis sul viga on?'
