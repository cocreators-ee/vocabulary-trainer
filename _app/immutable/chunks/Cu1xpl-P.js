In Estonian, it can refer to the city of Paris itself or be used as an adjective referring to French things or products, particularly colors like Prussian blue (Pariisi sinine) and specific items like Pariisi potatoes (Pariisi kartulid). The genitive case indicates possession or relationship - so 'pariisi' literally means 'of Paris' or 'Paris's'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:i,translation:s,context:e};export{e as context,a as default,i as sentences,s as translation,r as understood};
