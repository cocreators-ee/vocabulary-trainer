It's used with the genitive case and indicates a point of view, aspect, or reason. For example, 'Maitse poolest' means 'in terms of taste' or 'as for taste'. It can also mean 'due to' or 'because of' when indicating reasons or causes, as in 'Piletid saadi vana tutvuse poolest' meaning 'Tickets were obtained due to an old acquaintance'. The word historically comes from the genitive case of 'pool' (half/part), so it literally means something like 'from the side/aspect of'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:t};export{t as context,a as default,e as sentences,o as translation,s as understood};
