It functions as a polite way of asking for something similar to English 'could you' or 'would you'. This form is used in formal or polite requests and questions, making it more courteous than the direct imperative form. The word often appears with the particle 'ehk' which means 'perhaps' or 'maybe', adding a layer of politeness and uncertainty to the request.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:t};export{t as context,s as default,e as sentences,o as translation,a as understood};
