In Estonian, the partitive case indicates a partial or indefinite quantity of something. So when someone says 'poiss murrab juba häält', it means 'the boy already has a voice breaking' or 'the boy's voice is already changing/breaking'. This word form specifically refers to an incomplete or ongoing action related to one's voice, such as during puberty when the voice begins to change. The partitive case here emphasizes that this is a process that is happening but not yet complete.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:i};export{i as context,n as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
