It can be used to describe someone who behaves erratically or does unusual things, or something that is extreme or out of the ordinary. The word combines 'hullu' (mad/crazy) with 'meelne' (which relates to mind/spirit), literally meaning 'mind-mad' or 'spirit-crazy'. It's similar in structure and meaning to words like 'lunatic' in English but is commonly used more casually in Estonian.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:n};export{n as context,t as default,e as sentences,a as translation,i as understood};
