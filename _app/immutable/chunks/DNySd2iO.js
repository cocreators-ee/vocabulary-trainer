However, based on the dictionary definitions provided for related words like 'isoleerima', there seems to be some confusion in the data. The dictionary shows definitions for 'isoleerima' (meaning 'to isolate'), but this doesn't match with what would typically be expected from 'ühendust', which derives from a root meaning 'connection'. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is an error in the data or if there's a specialized usage. Based on the word form 'ühendust', which appears to be partitive case of 'ühendus' (connection), it would typically relate to concepts like connection, contact, or link.",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
