It literally combines 'pere' (family) and 'mees' (man), so it originally referred to the head of a household or family. Over time, its meaning expanded to include owners/proprietors of property (houses, farms, businesses), landlords, hosts who entertain guests, and bosses in employment contexts. In biology, it also refers to a host organism for parasites. The word is masculine in form but can refer to both men and women in certain professional contexts.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:s};export{s as context,t as default,e as sentences,o as translation,n as understood};
