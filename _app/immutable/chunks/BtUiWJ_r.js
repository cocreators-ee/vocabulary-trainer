It's equivalent to English words like 'a little bit', 'somewhat', 'slightly', or 'a tiny amount'. The word modifies the quantity or extent of something without specifying exactly how much. It can be used with various parts of speech - before nouns (like in 'veidi kulunud kingad' - slightly worn shoes), as an exclamation encouraging rest ('Puhka veidi!' - Rest a little!), or to describe characteristics ('Ta on veidi laisk' - He is somewhat lazy).
