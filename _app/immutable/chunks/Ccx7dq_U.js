Primarily, it means to think, believe, or assume something that may not be entirely certain (e.g., 'I don't know for sure, but I think...'). It can also mean to guess or speculate about something ('to guess what someone is thinking'). Additionally, it's used when considering or counting something as part of a group ('time spent in hospital is counted as part of general service'), and in more formal contexts, it means to assign someone to a post or job (e.g., 'athletes were assigned to the Olympic team'). The word can be conjugated in various forms like arvan (I think), arvad (you think), arvab (he/she thinks), etc. It often carries a sense of estimation rather than absolute certainty.",n={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:a};export{a as context,n as default,t as sentences,e as translation,o as understood};
