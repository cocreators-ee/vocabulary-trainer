It is a noun that describes the facial expression of happiness or amusement. In different contexts, it can refer to a gentle smile (like 'naermiseks') or more hearty laughter. The word comes from the verb 'naerma' meaning 'to laugh', so 'naeratus' represents the actual act or result of laughing - the smile on someone's face.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:s};export{s as context,n as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
