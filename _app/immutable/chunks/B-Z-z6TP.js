It can function as 'as if' when introducing a conditional clause, 'like' for comparisons, or 'than' to introduce comparative constructions.  It also has uses as an equative comparison marker (e.g., 'as...as') and even colloquially as 'how?'. The word is derived from the instructive plural of 'kuka' (who) and can also be related to 'kuu' (month). Finnish comparative constructions often use 'kuin' with a fixed word order: [comparative] + kuin + [comparee in nominative case].",e={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:i,context:o};export{o as context,e as default,n as sentences,i as translation,a as understood};
