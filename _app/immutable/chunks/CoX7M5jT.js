It expresses obligation, necessity or compulsion - similar to how English uses 'must', 'have to', or 'need to'. The word indicates that the speaker is required or compelled to perform an action. This grammatical form combines the person (first), number (singular), tense (present), and mood indicative) with the root meaning of obligation from the verb 'pidama' (to hold/keep/must).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
