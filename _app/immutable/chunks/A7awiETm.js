In Estonian, adjectives change their endings based on the grammatical case.

So 'viimase' specifically refers to 'the last one (of many)' or 'a final instance' rather than definitively 'the very last'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:i,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,i as translation,a as understood};
