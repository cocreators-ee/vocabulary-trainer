It can be used to express when there isn't enough of something (money, people, time) or when something falls short of a requirement. The word appears in different contexts: 1) showing lack/deficiency of things ('tuli rahast puudu' - money was lacking), 2) indicating how much is needed for completion ('kümme minutit puudu' - ten minutes short), and 3) as an extension to the verb 'olema' (to be) meaning someone or something is not present where needed ('Peeter on puudu' - Peter is missing/absent).",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,s as understood};
