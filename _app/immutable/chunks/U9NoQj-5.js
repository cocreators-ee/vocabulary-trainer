It can translate to 'so', 'then', or even function as 'yes' or 'yeah'. It’s often used to emphasize a statement ('so much'), indicate agreement, or introduce the main clause of a sentence after an auxiliary clause (like one starting with 'jos' meaning 'if').  It also appears in common phrases and can be used for confirmation. The word originates from the instructive plural form of 'ne', which means 'they'. It is often used as a response to confirm something, similar to saying 'of course'.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:t};export{t as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,s as understood};
