In this zoological context, it specifically refers to birds whose young leave the nest shortly after hatching from their eggs. These are called 'nest-leavers' or 'precocial' birds in English. The term describes a developmental strategy where chicks are fully developed at hatching and can leave the nest immediately rather than remaining altricial (helpless).",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,a as translation,s as understood};
