The word also has a secondary usage as an archaic polite term for addressing someone of higher social standing, and it appears in exclamations expressing surprise, admiration, or distress. In the example sentence provided by the user ('võtad'), this is actually part of the phrase 'kui kergelt sa elu võtad' which means 'how lightly you take life', but the main word being analyzed here is 'heldus'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:a,context:s};export{s as context,n as default,e as sentences,a as translation,t as understood};
