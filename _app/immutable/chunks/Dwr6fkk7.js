As a preposition with the abessive case, it means 'without'. As an adverb, it can mean 'free of charge' or 'on the house'. It's derived from Proto-Finnic and appears to be related to the genitive singular of 'ilm'. In different grammatical contexts, it expresses being without something essential either physically (without glasses) or conceptually (without a prolonged explanation).",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
