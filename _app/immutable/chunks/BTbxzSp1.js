It can indicate spatial relationships (like flying *over* an object), temporal relationships (*after* a certain time), or quantity (*more than* a number).  It often takes the genitive case as its complement, but sometimes partitive is also possible depending on context and personal preference. The word 'yli' cannot take possessive suffixes; for those cases, 'ylitse' is used instead.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,e as sentences,t as translation,o as understood};
