In Estonian grammar, the genitive case typically indicates possession or origin. So when you see 'mäe', it means 'of the mountain' or 'from the mountain'. For example, if someone says 'tõusin mäe peale', they mean 'I climbed up of/from the mountain'. The dictionary definition confirms that 'mäe' is specifically the genitive singular form of 'mägi'.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:o};export{o as context,t as default,e as sentences,n as translation,i as understood};
