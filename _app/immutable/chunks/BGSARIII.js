It's used to express affection and endearment towards someone or something. In the first sentence, it appears as the singular nominative form 'arm' meaning 'love' (though this usage might be less common). In the second sentence, it's in the partitive case 'armas' modifying the word 'lapsega' (with a child) to mean 'was dear/lovely with a child'. In the third sentence, it's again in the nominative plural form 'armad' describing flowers as being lovely/sweet.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:s};export{s as context,n as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
