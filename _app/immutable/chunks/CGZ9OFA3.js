It doesn’t differentiate between the two, but you can use terms like 'pikkukaupunki' for a small town and 'suurkaupunki' for a large city. Historically, it referred to cities granted rights by the Swedish Crown, but nowadays any municipality can choose to call itself a 'kaupunki'. The word declines in different cases depending on its role in the sentence; for example, 'kaupungin' means 'of the city', and 'kaupunkeihin' means 'to the cities'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:e,context:t};export{t as context,a as default,n as sentences,e as translation,i as understood};
