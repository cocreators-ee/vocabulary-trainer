However, in this context, it appears to be used metaphorically to mean 'achieved', 'done', or 'completed'. It suggests that something has been successfully accomplished or finished through effort. This is similar to how English might say 'I've done a lot of work' or 'We've achieved something great'.",n={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:o,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,e as sentences,o as translation,s as understood};
