It's commonly used to indicate that someone has died. In Estonian, death can be poetically referred to as the extinguishing of a 'life candle' ('eluküünal'), as shown in the dictionary definition where it says 'Kellegi eluküünalt kustutama, ära puhuma kedagi tapma', meaning 'to extinguish someone's life candle, blow it out - to kill someone'. Therefore, when saying that a 'vanake suri' (old person died), it can be understood as the old person's life candle going out.",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:a};export{a as context,t as default,e as sentences,s as translation,n as understood};
