It can refer to a fraction of a whole, a distinct element of something larger, or an individual contribution. The word declines based on case and number; for example, 'osan' is the genitive singular form ('of the part'), while 'osat' is the nominative plural ('parts').  The suffix '-osa' can also be added to other words to indicate a component or section (e.g., 'pääosa' - main part/role).",n={understood:!0,sentences:o,translation:e,context:t};export{t as context,n as default,o as sentences,e as translation,a as understood};
