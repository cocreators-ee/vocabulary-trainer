It can describe someone who is alone or lonely (without companions), something that is the only one of its kind, separate or isolated from others, or in small numbers/few. The word derives from 'üks' meaning 'one' plus the suffix '-ik'. It's commonly used to describe solitary people (like a single child in a family), isolated objects (a single pine tree on the roadside), or when referring to few items (only a few lights were on).",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:o};export{o as context,t as default,e as sentences,s as translation,n as understood};
