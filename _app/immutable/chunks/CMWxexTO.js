It can be used for time periods (the beginning of an hour, day, year), events (the start of a meeting, concert), or physical locations (the starting point of a road). The word declines regularly in Estonian with forms like 'alguse' (genitive), 'algust' (partitive), and 'algusesse' (illative). It's commonly used in contexts where something new is initiated, such as 'midagi algust tegema' meaning 'to start something'.",a={understood:!0,sentences:t,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,a as default,t as sentences,e as translation,s as understood};
