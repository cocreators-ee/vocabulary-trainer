However, it can also mean 'ring' in a more general sense, like a loop or hoop. The word originates from Proto-Finnic and has connections to Proto-Germanic roots meaning 'ring'. It declines based on grammatical case, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as possessive suffixes indicating who owns the ring/tire. For example, 'renkaani' means 'my tire'.",s={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:e,context:o};export{o as context,s as default,n as sentences,e as translation,r as understood};
