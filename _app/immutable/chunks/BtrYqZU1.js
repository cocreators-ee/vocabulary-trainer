It can be small and uncultivated, or more carefully maintained. The declension shows that it changes form depending on its role in the sentence – for example, 'pihan' means 'of the yard', while 'pihaan' indicates movement *to* the yard.  The possessive forms indicate whose yard it is (e.g., 'pihani' means 'my yard').",i={understood:!0,sentences:a,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,i as default,a as sentences,e as translation,t as understood};
