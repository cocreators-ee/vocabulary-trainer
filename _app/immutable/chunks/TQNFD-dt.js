It refers to the frozen, crystalline state of water that falls as precipitation. The dictionary definitions show it can also refer to cocaine (slang), but this is less common.  The word declines based on case; for example, 'lumen' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of snow', and 'lumet' is the nominative plural meaning 'snows'. Possessive forms are also shown, like 'lumeni' which means 'my snow'.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:s};export{s as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,t as understood};
