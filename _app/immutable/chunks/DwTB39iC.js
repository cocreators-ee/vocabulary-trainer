It can refer to physical appearance (something visually displeasing) but also to behavior or actions that are considered improper, shameful, or against good manners. The dictionary shows it has two main meanings: 1) lacking beauty, aesthetically unpleasant (like an ugly face, nose, appearance); and 2) blameworthy, reprehensible, indecent (like ugly deeds, stories, or lying). It's the opposite of 'ilus' (beautiful) and 'kaunis' (pretty).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:a};export{a as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
