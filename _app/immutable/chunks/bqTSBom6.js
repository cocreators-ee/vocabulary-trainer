It refers to a large celestial body that orbits around the Sun and is characterized by having a gaseous envelope or atmosphere. In astronomy, it specifically denotes bodies like Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto (which was historically considered a planet). The word can be used in various contexts including scientific discussions about planets, space travel plans to other planets, and speculative questions about life on other planets. It's also found in compound words like 'hiidplaneet' (giant planet), 'siseplaneet' (inner planet), 'väikeplaneet' (small planet), and 'välisplaneet' (outer planet).",s={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:n};export{n as context,s as default,e as sentences,t as translation,a as understood};
