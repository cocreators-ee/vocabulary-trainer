It can refer to a unit of language, like in the sentence 'This sentence has five words'. However, it also carries the meaning of someone’s statement or promise, as seen in 'I'll take your word for it'. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'sanan' is the genitive singular form ('of a word'), and 'sanat' is the nominative plural ('words').",t={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:s};export{s as context,t as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
