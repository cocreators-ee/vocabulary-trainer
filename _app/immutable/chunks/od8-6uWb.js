It refers to a piece of clothing worn on the upper body, typically outside and over other clothes. The word declines based on case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, and also possessive suffixes indicating who owns the coat. For example, 'takkini' means 'my coat', while 'takkiin' indicates movement *into* a coat (e.g., putting on a coat).",o={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:t,context:e};export{e as context,o as default,n as sentences,t as translation,i as understood};
