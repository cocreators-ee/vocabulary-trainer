It corresponds to English 'was' when referring to a single subject or entity. In Finnish, verbs conjugate for person and number, so while this specific form means 'was/were' in the simple past tense, other forms like 'olimme' (we were) or 'olivat' (they were) would be used for different subjects. This is one of the most fundamental verb forms in Finnish as it's used to express existence and states in the past.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:s,context:n};export{n as context,o as default,e as sentences,s as translation,t as understood};
