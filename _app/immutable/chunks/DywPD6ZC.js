It can refer to a public sector job, or simply a role someone holds. The declension shows how the word changes based on its grammatical function in a sentence – nominative for the subject, genitive showing possession, partitive indicating an incomplete object, and so on.  The possessive forms indicate who *holds* the office (e.g., 'virkani' means 'my office').
