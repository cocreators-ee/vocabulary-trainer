It translates to 'their' or 'theirs' in English. It’s used to indicate possession, similar to 'heidän', but often without a possessive suffix on the main noun. Additionally, it can be used with certain verbs that require a genitive case, like 'pitää' (to have to) and 'tulla' (to come), expressing obligation or necessity. It is also sometimes used colloquially as a replacement for 'heidän'.",o={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:t,context:i};export{i as context,o as default,e as sentences,t as translation,n as understood};
