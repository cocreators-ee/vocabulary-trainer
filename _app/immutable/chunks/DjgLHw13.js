It is used to emphasize that something is the one and only, with no others like it. In grammar, 'ainus' can appear in different cases depending on its function in a sentence - nominative (ainsus), genitive (ainsa), partitive (ainust), etc. For example: nominative 'Ainus on see' means 'The only one is this'; genitive 'Ta oli ainsaks ellujäänud' means 'He was the only one to survive'; and in the sentence 'See on ainus võimalus', it's used as an adjective modifying 'võimalus' (possibility).",a={understood:!0,sentences:n,translation:e,context:s};export{s as context,a as default,n as sentences,e as translation,i as understood};
