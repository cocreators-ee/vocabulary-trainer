It originates from Latin and Ancient Greek roots. The word declines based on grammatical case, with different forms for singular and plural subjects and objects. For example, 'melodian' is the genitive form (possessive), while 'melodiaa' is the partitive form.  The possessive forms change depending on who owns the melody – 'melodiani' means 'my melody', 'melodiasi' means 'your melody', and so on.",i={understood:!0,sentences:e,translation:n,context:o};export{o as context,i as default,e as sentences,n as translation,a as understood};
