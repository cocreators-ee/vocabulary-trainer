In the genitive case, it indicates possession or relationship - so 'vastuse' can mean 'of an answer/response' or be used to show what belongs to an answer. It's commonly used in phrases like asking for someone's opinion on a question ('Milline on sinu vastuse sellele küsimusele?' means 'What is your answer to this question?').",t={understood:!0,sentences:s,translation:e,context:n};export{n as context,t as default,s as sentences,e as translation,o as understood};
