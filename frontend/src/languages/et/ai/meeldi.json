  "context": "In Estonian, 'meeldi' is the singular form of the verb 'meelda', which means 'to like' or 'to appeal to'. It's used when the subject is in the third person singular (he/she/it) and indicates that something is pleasing or enjoyable to someone. The verb follows an unusual Estonian pattern where it comes after the object rather than before it."
