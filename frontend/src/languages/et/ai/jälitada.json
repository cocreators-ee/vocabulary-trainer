  "context": "The Estonian verb 'jälitada' means to follow, pursue, or track someone or something. It can be used in various contexts such as following a person physically (like the police pursuing a criminal), observing something carefully (like watching a bird move between trees), or keeping tabs on someone's movements. This verb implies an active pursuit or observation rather than passive following."
