  "context": "The Estonian word 'jälitada' means to follow, chase, pursue or track someone or something. It can be used in literal contexts like hunters following game ('kütid jälitavad põtra' - 'hunters follow the bear'), but also metaphorically when referring to persistent thoughts or problems that haunt someone. In military context, it specifically means to attack retreating enemies. The verb indicates continuous action and often implies persistence or pursuit."
