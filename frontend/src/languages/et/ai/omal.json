  "context": "The Estonian word 'omal' is a possessive pronoun that means 'one's own' or 'personal'. It indicates possession belonging to the subject of the sentence. This word is in the adessive case, which typically shows location or instrumentality, but here it functions as a reflexive possessive form meaning something belongs to oneself rather than someone else specifically identified."
