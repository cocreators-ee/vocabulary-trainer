  "context": "The word 'reedel' is an Estonian adjective that means something happening or occurring specifically on Friday. It's formed from the noun 'reede' (Friday) and the suffix '-ne' which turns nouns into adjectives describing properties related to that noun. So anything described as 'reedel' or in plural form 'reedesed' refers to events, activities, or things that happen on Fridays."
