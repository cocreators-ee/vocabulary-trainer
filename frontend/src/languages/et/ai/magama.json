  "context": "The Estonian word 'magama' is the basic infinitive form of the verb meaning 'to sleep'. It's commonly used to express the action of sleeping. The first person singular form would be 'magan', and in the third person plural, it becomes 'magavad'. The word can also function as a noun when referring to the state or act of sleeping, often seen with additional suffixes like '-ja' (one who sleeps) forming agent nouns."
