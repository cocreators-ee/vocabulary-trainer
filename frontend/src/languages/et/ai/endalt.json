  "context": "In Estonian, 'endalt' is an adverbial form meaning 'from oneself' or 'from one's own body.' It indicates that something (like a vaccine, sample, or treatment) is derived from the person's own body rather than from an external source. This prefix form comes from the reflexive pronoun 'enda' (oneself). In medical contexts, it specifically refers to vaccines made from bacteria obtained from the patient's own body."
