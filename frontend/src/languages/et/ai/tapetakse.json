  "context": "The word 'tapetakse' is the 3rd person plural present indicative passive form of the verb 'tappama', which means 'to kill'. The passive voice indicates that someone or something receives the action rather than performs it. So 'tapetakse' specifically means 'is killed/are killed' - referring to multiple people or things being killed by someone else."
