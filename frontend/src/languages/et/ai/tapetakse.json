It means that something is being killed or slaughtered, typically referring to animals being sacrificed or killed, but can also refer to people being killed in various contexts like warfare or execution. The word often carries a sense of ritual killing or sacrifice, as indicated by the dictionary definition mentioning 'ohverdusviis' (sacrificial method)."
