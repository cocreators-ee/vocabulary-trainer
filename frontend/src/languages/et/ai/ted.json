  "context": "The word 'aed' in Estonian means garden or yard. It refers to a cultivation area where kitchen vegetables, fruits, berries, herbs, and flowers are grown, often enclosed with a fence. The word can also be used more broadly to refer to any fenced-in area for a specific purpose (like an animal enclosure), or as the second part of compound words describing different types of gardens or fences."
