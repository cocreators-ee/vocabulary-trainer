  "context": "In Estonian, 'surm' means death or dying. It's a noun that refers to the cessation of life in an organism. The word can be used literally (physical death), metaphorically (personified as Death with a scythe), or figuratively (meaning ruin, disaster, or hardship). Estonian uses the same root form for both singular and plural partitive cases ('surma'), and it has various compound forms indicating different types of death like 'poomissurm' (execution by hanging) or 'viinasurm' (alcohol-related death)."
