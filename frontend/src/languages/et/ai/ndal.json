  "context": "The word 'ndal' is a colloquial or informal form of Estonian that appears to be derived from 'nädala', meaning 'week'. It's used in expressions referring to activities happening within the current or upcoming week. The 'n' at the beginning might be a reduced form of 'nä-', similar to how 'see nädal' (this week) is commonly shortened in spoken language."
