  "context": "The word 'jätan' is from Estonian and means 'I leave' or 'I save'. In this context, it's used in the phrase 'Jätan viimase ampsu sulle' which translates to 'I leave the last bite for you.' The word 'ampsu' refers to a bite of food. So 'jätan' here specifically means saving or leaving something (the last bite) for someone else."
