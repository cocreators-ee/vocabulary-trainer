  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaenlane' means enemy or foe. It can refer to a person who harbors hostility toward someone else, showing animosity, ill will, or unfriendliness. The word is formed from 'vaen' (hostility) and the suffix '-lane' (person), literally meaning 'hostile person.' In its basic form (nominative singular), it's 'vaenlane,' while in genitive case it becomes 'vaenlase' and in partitive case 'vaenlast.' The word has broader applications too - it can refer to an adversary in war or battle, and metaphorically to anything that causes harm or destruction."
