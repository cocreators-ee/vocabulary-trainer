  "context": "The Estonian word 'miski' is an indefinite pronoun that can mean 'something' or 'anything'. It's used to refer to an unspecified, unidentified person, thing, phenomenon, or circumstance. In affirmative sentences, it indicates the presence of something unknown or unspecified (midagi), while in negative sentences it means 'not anything' or 'nothing' at all (ei midagi). The word can also be used adjectivally to mean 'some' or 'any', and as an adverb to indicate approximation ('approximately', 'about')."
