  "context": "The word 'kuti' in Estonian is an informal term that can be translated to 'guy', 'fellow', or 'like' depending on the context. It’s often used colloquially and can sometimes carry a slightly condescending tone, similar to calling someone 'buddy' or 'mate' in English. It can also function as a comparative particle meaning 'like'."
