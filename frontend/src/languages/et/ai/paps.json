  "context": "The Estonian word 'paps' is an informal, colloquial term for father or dad. It's a diminutive form similar to how 'papa' works in English - a familiar way to refer to one's father. The examples show it being used in everyday family contexts: asking if someone's father is home, borrowing money from him, and discussing matters with both parents ('paps ja mams' meaning 'dad and mom')."
