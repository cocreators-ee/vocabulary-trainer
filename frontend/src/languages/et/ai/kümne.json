  "context": "The word 'kümne' is the partitive case form of the Estonian number 'kümme' (ten). The partitive case is used to indicate an indefinite quantity or when talking about a subset of something. In this form, it would be used when saying phrases like 'ten (of something)' where you're referring to a portion or amount of ten items rather than just the number itself."
