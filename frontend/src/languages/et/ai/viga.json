  "context": "The Estonian word 'viga' has multiple meanings. It can refer to a mistake or error (failure to comply with rules, norms, standards), a flaw or defect in something being out of order, a physical injury or malaise, or a deficiency/lack that prevents perfection. The word changes form depending on case and number - its genitive is 'vea', partitive is 'viga', plural nominative is 'vead'. It's commonly used in expressions like 'mis sul viga on?' (what's wrong with you?) and 'pole viga' (it's okay/no problem)."
