  "context": "The Estonian word 'raskelt' is an adverb that means 'in a difficult manner' or 'with difficulty'. It modifies verbs to indicate that something was done with considerable effort, struggle, or hardship. The word comes from the adjective 'raske' (difficult, heavy) and the '-lt' suffix forms the adverbial form."
