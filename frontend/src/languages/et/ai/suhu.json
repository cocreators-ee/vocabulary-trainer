  "context": "The word 'suhu' in Estonian is part of the idiom 'kont on hammaste vahel suhu' which means to have something stuck between your teeth, metaphorically referring to becoming a topic of gossip or discussion. It comes from the literal meaning where food (kont) gets stuck between teeth and becomes a source of embarrassment or public scrutiny."
