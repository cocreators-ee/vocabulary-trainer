  "context": "The Estonian word 'suhu' is the illative case form of the word 'suhe', which means 'relationship' or 'condition'. In this context, 'suhu' is used idiomatically to mean being in a good state emotionally or mentally. It's similar to English expressions like 'in high spirits' or 'in good mood'. The illative case indicates movement into or direction towards something - so being 'in good suhu' means moving into or maintaining a positive emotional state."
