  "context": "The Estonian word 'pooleli' is an adverb meaning something that is halfway through, unfinished or incomplete. It indicates that an activity, process, or task has been started but not completed. For example, if someone leaves their studies 'kooli pooleli', it means they left school before finishing. Similarly, if a construction project remains 'pooleli ehitus', it's an unfinished building. This word is commonly used to describe any ongoing but not yet finished state of activities or projects."
