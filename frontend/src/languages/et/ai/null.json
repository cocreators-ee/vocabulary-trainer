  "context": "The Estonian word 'null' means zero. It's used as a number to represent the absence of quantity or value. In mathematics, it serves as the additive identity (5 + 0 = 5). Beyond its numerical meaning, 'null' is also commonly used in time expressions (like 'kell seitse null null' for 7:00), scores in sports ('4-0' becomes 'neli null'), and to indicate something has no value or importance ('tema arvamus on mulle null' - his opinion means nothing to me). The word declines regularly with cases like genitive 'nulli', partitive 'nulli', illative 'nulli', etc."
