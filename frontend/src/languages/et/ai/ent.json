  "context": "The Estonian word 'ent' is a conjunction used to indicate contrast or opposition. It functions similarly to English words like 'but,' 'however,' or 'nevertheless.' The dictionary definition explains it as a conjunctive particle (konj) that appears less frequently than 'aga' or 'kuid' and has a more literary character. Its primary function is to connect clauses where two components are contrasted, either directly or indirectly. It can also introduce limiting or clarifying sentence parts. In its independent clause usage at the beginning of a sentence, it connects with previous context, sometimes introducing a topic rather than a strong opposition."
