  "context": "The Estonian verb 'sõita' means to travel or move using some form of transportation. It is used when referring to going somewhere by car, bus, train, bicycle, or other vehicles. The verb changes form depending on the subject and tense - in present tense it would be 'sõidan' (I drive/go), past tense 'sõitis' (he/she/it went/drive), and with the '-mas' ending it indicates ongoing action like 'sõitmas' (traveling)."
