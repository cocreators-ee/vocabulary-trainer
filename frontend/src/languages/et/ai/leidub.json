  "context": "The Estonian word 'leidub' is the 3rd person singular present indicative form of the verb 'leidma', which means 'to find'. It's used in an impersonal construction to express that something exists or can be found, similar to English expressions like 'there is/are' or 'is found'. This form is commonly used when talking about the existence or availability of things, people, or possibilities."
