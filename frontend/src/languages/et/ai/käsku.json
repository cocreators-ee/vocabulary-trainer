  "context": "The Estonian word 'käsku' is the partitive form of 'käsk', which means commandment or command. It's most commonly used in religious contexts, particularly referring to the Ten Commandments (kümme käsku) from the Bible. The word appears to be in its partitive case here, suggesting it could be part of a phrase like 'ten commandments' where it would take the partitive form."
