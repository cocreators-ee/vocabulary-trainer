  "context": "The word 'lõpu' is the genitive case of the Estonian noun 'lõpp', which means 'end' or 'finish'. In the genitive case, it shows possession or relationship to something - so 'lõpu' can mean 'of the end', 'belonging to the end', or used with prepositions indicating direction toward an ending. It's commonly used in phrases like 'kuni lõpuni' (until the end) and is often seen before nouns that complete a phrase, similar to English constructions using 'end' as a modifier."
