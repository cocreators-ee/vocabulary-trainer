  "context": "The Estonian word 'öelnud' is the past tense of the verb 'öelda', which means 'to say' or 'to tell'. It functions as a perfect participle in compound tenses, indicating that an action has been completed. This form typically follows auxiliary verbs like 'olema' (to be) to form the present perfect tense. For example: 'on öelnud' (has said), 'öelnud on' (said/he/she/they have said)."
