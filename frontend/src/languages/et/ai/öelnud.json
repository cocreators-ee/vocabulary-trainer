  "context": "The word 'öelnud' appears to be a typo or misrepresentation in the source text. Based on the context provided in the dictionary definition, it seems the intended word is 'ususalgaja', which means an apostate - someone who has abandoned their religious beliefs or faith. The Estonian word 'öelnud' actually means 'has said/spoken' (from öelda - to say), but doesn't fit with the context of the definitions provided."
