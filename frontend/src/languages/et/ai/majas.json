  "context": "The word 'majas' is the inessive singular form of 'maja' (house). In Estonian grammar, the inessive case indicates location inside or within something. So 'majas' specifically means 'inside the house' or 'at home'. It's used to indicate where someone or something is located - being inside a building or structure rather than outside."
