  "context": "The Estonian word 'millelegi' is a postposition used to indicate direction or purpose toward an unspecified object. It typically follows nouns and indicates movement towards, involvement with, or relation to something. The word combines the interrogative pronoun 'mille' (to what/which) with the allative case suffix '-gi', creating a construction that means 'toward something'. This is commonly used in contexts where the specific object isn't specified but the direction or purpose toward it is important."
