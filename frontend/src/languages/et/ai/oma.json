  "context": "In Estonian, 'oma' is a possessive pronoun that means 'one's own' or 'own'. It indicates possession in the third person but refers back to the subject of the sentence. For example, 'Oma kodu on kõige ilusam' means 'One's own home is the most beautiful.' The word 'oma' agrees with the noun it modifies in case and number."
