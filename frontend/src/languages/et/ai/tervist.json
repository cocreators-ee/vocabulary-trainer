  "context": "The Estonian word 'tervist' is a versatile greeting and well-wishing expression that can be used in several contexts. It's commonly used as a general greeting similar to 'hello', but it literally means 'health' or 'wellbeing'. It's also frequently said after someone sneezes (similar to 'bless you'), when parting ways, as a toast, or when wishing someone good health. The word comes from the Estonian root 'terve' meaning healthy or well."
