  "context": "The word 'minagi' in Estonian is composed of 'mina' (meaning 'I' or 'me') plus the emphatic particle '-gi', creating a construction that means 'also I' or 'me too'. It's used to emphasize inclusion or similarity with something previously mentioned. The dictionary entry provided actually shows 'ainult minagi' meaning 'only me too', which suggests it can be combined with other words for more specific meanings."
