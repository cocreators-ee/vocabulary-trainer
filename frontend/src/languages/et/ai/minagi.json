  "context": "The word 'minagi' in Estonian is a combination of 'mina' (I/me) and 'agi' (also/too). It's used to express agreement or inclusion, similar to saying 'me too' or 'also me' in English. The particle 'agi' adds emphasis that the speaker also shares the same opinion or experience as someone else."
