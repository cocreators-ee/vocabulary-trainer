It can refer to the Earth's moon (the celestial body), a month as a period of time, or any natural satellite of a planet in astronomical contexts. As the moon, it describes our natural satellite that orbits Earth and phases like waxing/waning moons. As 'month', it refers to calendar months or approximately 30-day periods."
