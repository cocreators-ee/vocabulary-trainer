  "context": "The Estonian word 'la' has multiple meanings depending on context. When used as a repeated nonsense syllable like 'La la la...', it's similar to English 'la-la-la'. However, when appearing in words like 'lauluga', it functions as the instrumental case suffix meaning 'with'. In other contexts, it can be part of prepositions or have different meanings based on word formation. The exact meaning must be determined by how it appears within specific words and sentences."
