  "context": "The word 'politseile' is an Estonian directional case form (allative) that indicates movement toward or destination to the police. It's formed by adding '-le' suffix to the base word 'politsei' (police), showing directionality rather than location. This case is used when someone goes to visit, approach, send something to, or direct attention toward the police. The allative case in Estonian answers the questions 'where to?' or 'toward whom/what?'."
