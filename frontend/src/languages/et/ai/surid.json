  "context": "The word 'surid' is the past tense plural form of the verb 'suriada' (to die) in Estonian. In this context, it refers to people who died as a result of kurnatus (exhaustion, extreme fatigue). The dictionary definition shows that prisoners and others suffering from severe exhaustion could literally die from this condition - 'surid kurnatusse' means 'died into exhaustion' or 'died because of exhaustion'."
