  "context": "The word 'tööd' is the plural form of 'töö' in Estonian, meaning work, job, task, or labor. It can refer to multiple pieces of work, various jobs, or tasks that need to be completed. In Estonian grammar, adding '-d' to a noun typically makes it plural, so tööd represents multiple works or jobs rather than a single one."
