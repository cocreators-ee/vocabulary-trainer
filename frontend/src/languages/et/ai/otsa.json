  "context": "The Estonian word 'otsa' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean physically 'on top of' or 'onto something', as in placing one bag on another or climbing a tree's top. It can also mean 'at the end of' (temporally or spatially), such as doing one mistake after another. In some contexts, it indicates 'throughout' a period of time like 'night through'. Additionally, it functions as an adverb meaning 'onto' when describing movement toward something, and can indicate completion or exhaustion when used with verbs like 'got the money otsa' (ran out)."
