  "context": "The word 'ohtlikud' is the plural nominative form of the adjective 'ohtlik', meaning dangerous or hazardous. It describes things that pose a threat, risk, or potential harm to people or property. The '-d' ending indicates it's in plural form, and since there's no genitive case marker like '-de' or '-da', this appears to be the nominative plural case used when the dangerous things are the subject of the sentence."
