  "context": "The word 'ameeriklane' is an Estonian noun meaning 'an American person' or 'a citizen of the United States'. It's formed by combining 'Ameerika' (America) with the suffix '-lane' which denotes a person from a particular place. The plural form is 'ameeriklased'. This word can refer to any person from America, not just citizens of the USA, though it most commonly refers to US citizens in everyday usage."
