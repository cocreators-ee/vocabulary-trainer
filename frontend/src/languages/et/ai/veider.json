  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'veider' means strange, odd, or weird. It describes something that is unusual peculiar, or out of the ordinary. The word can be used to describe people (strange people), objects (a strange hat), situations, behavior, or experiences. From etymological perspective, it originates from Proto-Finnic *veiterä and cognates include Finnish veiterä meaning 'lively, brisk; sharp' and Votic veitere meaning 'quick, agile; brave'. In modern Estonian usage, however, the connotation is more toward strangeness rather than liveliness or bravery."
