  "context": "The word 'tuhande' is the partitive case form of the Estonian numeral 'tuhat' (meaning 'thousand'). In Estonian, numerals can change their ending depending on grammatical case. The partitive case is often used with numbers when they indicate an unspecified quantity or are followed by a noun in the genitive case. For example, 'tuhande inimese' means 'of thousands of people' or 'thousands of people', where 'inimeste' is the genitive plural of 'inimene' (person)."
