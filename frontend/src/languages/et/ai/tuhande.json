  "context": "The Estonian phrase 'viimase tuhande peal' is an idiom that has two main meanings: 1) indicating something or someone is in a critical state, worn out, or about to end (like being at the last thousand, meaning near completion or exhaustion), and 2) managing with difficulty or barely succeeding. It's commonly used to describe people who are very old, objects that are completely worn out, or situations that are barely working."
