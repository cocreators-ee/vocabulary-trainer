  "context": "In Estonian, 'kohut' is a noun that refers to duty, obligation, or responsibility. It's the genitive singular form of the word 'kohus', which means 'duty' or 'obligation'. This form typically appears in contexts where something belongs to duty (e.g., 'kohu all' - under duty), expresses what is required by duty ('kohustus' - obligation derived from duty), or indicates possession of duties ('oma kohustusi' - one's own responsibilities)."
