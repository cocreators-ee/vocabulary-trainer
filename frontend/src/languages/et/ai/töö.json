  "context": "In Estonian, 'töö' is a versatile word that primarily means work or employment. It can refer to any activity requiring mental or physical effort, the process of working, the result of one's labor (like an artwork or research), or even the functioning/operation of something (like machinery). The noun has specific declension patterns with different forms like 'tööd' in partitive and plural nominative, 'töösse' in illative case, etc. It can be combined with many prefixes to form compound words describing different types of work."
