  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunduvad' is the plural form of the verb 'tunne', which means 'to seem' or 'to appear'. It describes how things look from a particular perspective, especially referring to objects that appear different due to distance or atmospheric conditions. In visual perception, distant objects may seem less sharp and lighter in color than nearby ones."
