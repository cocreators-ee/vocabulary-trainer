  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunneme' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the verb 'tundma', which means 'to feel', 'to sense', or 'to perceive'. It indicates that a group (including the speaker) currently experiences or senses something. The word derives from the Proto-Finnic root *tunne- meaning 'feeling' or 'sensation'. In Estonian grammar, this form follows the typical verb conjugation pattern for 1st person plural present tense verbs ending in -me."
