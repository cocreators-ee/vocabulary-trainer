  "context": "The Estonian verb 'sattuda' means to end up in a particular situation, often by chance or accident. It's used when someone finds themselves in a location or circumstance without deliberate planning. The word implies a sense of randomness or unintended outcome - you didn't plan to be there, but somehow it happened. It can refer to physical locations (getting lost) or abstract situations (ending up in trouble)."
