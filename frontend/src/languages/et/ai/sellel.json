  "context": "The Estonian word 'sellel' is an adessive singular pronoun that means 'on', 'has', or 'with this/that'. It is formed by adding the '-l' suffix to the demonstrative pronoun 'see' (this/that). In grammar, it's used to indicate location on something, possession, or association with a particular thing. For example, when saying 'Sellel on hea maitse', you're saying 'This has good taste'. The Wiktionary definition confirms this is the adessive singular form of 'see'."
