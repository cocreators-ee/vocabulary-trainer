  "context": "The word 'tegeleme' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'tegema', which means 'to do' or 'to make'. In this context, it's used in the reflexive/impersonal construction where it indicates what people are dealing with, working on, or being concerned about. The dictionary example shows how it's used to mean 'we deal with people' - specifically focusing on the inner, psychological aspects of humanity."
