  "context": "The word 'seisad' is the second person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'seisma', which means 'to stand' or 'to remain/stay'. It's used when addressing someone directly and telling them that they are currently in a standing position or remaining somewhere. In the example sentence, it's used as part of an expression to tell someone what they're doing wrong - literally 'what are you standing here with your legs spread like a pitchfork!'. The word can be conjugated differently for other persons (like 'seisame' for 'we stand', 'seisavad' for 'they stand') and tenses."
