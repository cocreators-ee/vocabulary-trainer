  "context": "The Estonian word 'surnud' is an adjective that primarily means 'dead'. It can refer to living beings (people, animals) that have died, or metaphorically describe things as lifeless, inactive, numb, or ceased functioning. The word has different forms depending on grammatical case - nominative and accusative singular/plural form is 'surnud', while genitive is 'surnu' and partitive is 'surnut'. It can also be used to describe things that have stopped working (like a dead radio signal), become rigid or lost elasticity, or even metaphorically for situations where something has been completely suppressed or eliminated."
