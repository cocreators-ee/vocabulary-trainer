  "context": "The Estonian verb 'surra' is the da-infinitive form of 'surema'. It has multiple meanings: 1) to cause someone's death, to kill (e.g., diseases killing people); 2) figuratively, to nurse or care for a dying person; 3) metaphorically, to smother, extinguish, muffle, weaken, or numb something (emotions, sounds, etc.); 4) temporarily to make numb (like legs from sitting too long). The word can be used in various contexts from literal killing to figurative expressions about suppressing emotions or sounds."
