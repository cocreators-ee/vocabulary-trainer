  "context": "The Estonian word 'kasu' has multiple related meanings. Most commonly it refers to 'profit' or 'economic gain' in financial contexts, such as business transactions or investments. It can also mean 'benefit', 'advantage', 'relief', 'help', or 'use'. As a postposition-like usage, it means 'for the benefit of someone/something' or 'in favor of'. The word comes from 'kasvama' (to grow) and originally had a sense of something growing or developing into beneficial outcomes."
