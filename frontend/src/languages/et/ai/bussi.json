  "context": "The word 'bussi' is the genitive form of the Estonian noun 'buss', which means 'bus'. In Estonian, nouns have different cases that indicate grammatical function. The genitive case typically shows possession or relationship - 'of a bus', 'belonging to a bus', or simply indicates what mode of transport was used. For example, 'Tulin bussiga tööle' means 'I came to work by bus'."
