  "context": "In Estonian, 'vaim' is a versatile word that can refer to the spiritual or mental aspects of a person. It can mean spirit, soul, mind, temperament, or mood depending on context. In its basic form it's a masculine noun (nominative case), and when used in different contexts, it might change slightly in meaning - for example 'vaimustus' means enthusiasm while 'vaimu' would be the genitive case meaning 'of spirit/mind'."
