  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaim' is a versatile noun with multiple meanings. It can refer to the human spirit or soul (everything psychic in a person, especially thinking and consciousness), as opposed to the physical body. It also means mentality, state of mind, inner being, and imagination. When used with certain suffixes like '-us', it indicates 'in the spirit of' or 'in a certain way/manner'. In religious contexts, it can refer to supernatural beings such as ghosts or guardian spirits, and in Christianity specifically, it refers to the Holy Spirit."
