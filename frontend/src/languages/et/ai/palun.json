  "context": "The Estonian word 'palun' is a common interjection used as a polite request or when giving something to someone. It functions similarly to English 'please' but can also be translated as 'kindly' or 'be so good'. The dictionary definitions show it's primarily used as a courtesy expression, with one source noting its use in situations of begging or complaint. It's often placed at the beginning of sentences when making requests."
