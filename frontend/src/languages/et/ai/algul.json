  "context": "The Estonian word 'algul' is an adverb that means 'at first', 'initially', or 'in the beginning'. It indicates something that happened early on before a change occurred. The word derives from 'algus' (beginning) but has become irregular in its form. It can be used at the start of sentences to describe how things were initially, before they changed or developed over time."
