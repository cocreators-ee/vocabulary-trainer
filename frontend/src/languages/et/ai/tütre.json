  "context": "The word 'tütre' is the genitive singular form of 'tütar' meaning daughter, but specifically in the context of a noble or aristocratic setting. It refers to a daughter from a wealthy or high-status family, particularly associated with manor houses ('lossi'). This term carries connotations of nobility and high social standing, differentiating it from the general word for daughter."
