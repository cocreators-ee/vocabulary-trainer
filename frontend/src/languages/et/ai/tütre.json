  "context": "The word 'tütre' is the partitive case form of 'tütar', which means 'daughter'. In Estonian, the partitive case often indicates incomplete action, partial possession, or in this context, it's commonly used when naming someone or referring to a daughter. The singular nominative form would be 'tütar', but 'tütre' appears in contexts where the partitive case is grammatically required."
