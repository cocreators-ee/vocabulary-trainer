  "context": "The word 'laeva' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'laev', which means ship or boat. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is often used after certain prepositions and verbs to indicate partiality or indefinite reference. Here it appears as a direct object in sentences meaning 'a ship'."
