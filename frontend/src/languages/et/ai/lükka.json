  "context": "The Estonian word 'lükka' is a verb that means to push, shove, or move something/someone forward. It often implies applying force to cause movement toward the speaker or an intended position. The word can be used literally (pushing physical objects) or figuratively (advancing in line, moving ahead). In the imperative form 'lükka!' it's a direct command telling someone to push something forward."
