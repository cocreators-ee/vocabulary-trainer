  "context": "Abielluma is an Estonian verb that means 'to marry' or 'wed'. It's used to describe the act of entering into marriage. The word comes from 'abiellu-' (related to marriage) and '-ma' (infinitive suffix). Examples show different subjects marrying - young people out of love, a mother remarrying in old age, and a daughter getting married at a young age."
