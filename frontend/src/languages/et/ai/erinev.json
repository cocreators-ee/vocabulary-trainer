  "context": "The Estonian word 'erinev' is an adjective meaning 'different'. It's in the singular nominative form. When used with plural nouns or in other cases, it would change form (e.g., erinevad for plural nominative). The word describes things that are not identical or have distinguishing characteristics from others."
