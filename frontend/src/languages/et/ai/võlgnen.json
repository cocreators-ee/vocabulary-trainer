  "context": "The word 'võlgnen' appears to be a form of the Estonian word for 'to owe' or 'to be indebted', but in this context, it seems to be used as a creative or poetic way to introduce an explanation. In the example sentence 'Võlgnen sulle väikese seletuse,' it literally means 'I owe you a small explanation.' This suggests that when someone says they 'owe' an explanation, they are acknowledging their responsibility to provide information or clarity about something."
