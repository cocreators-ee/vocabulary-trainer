  "context": "The word 'võmmid' is the plural form of 'võmm', which refers to undercover agents or secret police officers. It comes from Estonian slang and is used to describe people who operate secretly, often disguised in civilian clothes ('erariides'). The word carries a connotation of being sneaky or deceptive, as suggested by the example where they leave 'with long noses' (pika ninaga), implying they left with their tails between their legs after not finding anything suspicious. The related adjective form is 'sala', meaning secret or hidden."
