  "context": "The Estonian word 'üritame' is the 1st person plural present tense form of the verb 'üritama', meaning 'to try' or 'to attempt'. It indicates an effort to do something, often implying that success is not guaranteed. The word breaks down as 'ürita-' (try/attempt) + '-me' (we). In Estonian grammar, this follows a common pattern where the verb stem takes personal endings: üritama (infinitive), üritan (1st person singular - I try), üritad (2nd person singular - you try), üritab (3rd person singular - he/she/it tries), and üritame (1st person plural - we try)."
