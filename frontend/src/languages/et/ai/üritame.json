  "context": "The Estonian word 'üritame' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the verb 'ürita', which means 'to try' or 'to attempt'. It literally translates to 'we are trying' or 'we attempt'. This verb form is commonly used when expressing an action that a group is currently attempting or striving to accomplish. The root word 'ürita' comes from the Proto-Finnic word *yritä-, and in Estonian it can be conjugated into different forms depending on subject, tense, and mood."
