  "context": "The word 'numbri' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'number', which means 'number' or 'digit'. In Estonian, nouns change their endings to indicate different grammatical cases. The partitive case ('-i' ending) typically indicates an incomplete action or what someone has/doesn't have. So 'numbri' would be used when you're talking about having a number, needing a number, or seeing a number (rather than the complete number itself)."
