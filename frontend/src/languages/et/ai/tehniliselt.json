  "context": "Tehniliselt is an Estonian adverb that means 'technically' or 'from a technical standpoint.' It modifies verbs and statements to indicate that something is being considered or evaluated from a technical, mechanical, or procedural perspective rather than in terms of broader context, practicality, or aesthetics. This adverb is derived from the adjective 'tehniline' (technical) and is commonly used when discussing specifications, requirements, or evaluations related to technology, machinery, standards, or procedures."
