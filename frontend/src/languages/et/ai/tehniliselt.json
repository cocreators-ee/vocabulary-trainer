  "context": "The Estonian word 'tehniliselt' is an adverb that means 'technically' in English. It's formed by adding the '-lt' suffix to the adjective form of the word, which modifies it to indicate manner or perspective. This word is commonly used when discussing something from a technical viewpoint, focusing on technical aspects rather than practical or human elements."
