  "context": "Abiga is the comitative singular form of the Estonian word 'abi', meaning 'help' or 'assistance'. As a comitative case form, it indicates accompaniment or instrumentality - showing that something is done with the help or using something/someone as an instrument. It functions similarly to English phrases like 'with the help of' or 'using'. In Estonian grammar, the comitive case typically shows what means or by whom something is accomplished."
