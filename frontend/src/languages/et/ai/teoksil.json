  "context": "The word 'teoksil' is the elative case form of the noun 'teos', which means 'work', 'deed', or 'achievement'. In Estonian, the elative case indicates movement away from something. So 'teoksil' literally means 'from work/achievement' and is used to indicate that something has been accomplished, implemented, or carried out successfully. It implies completion of a task or achievement of an objective."
