  "context": "The word 'müristus' is a noun in Estonian that refers to the sound or rumble of thunder. It comes from the verb 'mürisema' (to rumble/thunder) and the suffix '-tus' which forms nouns indicating an action or its result. In the given example sentence, it's used with the partitive case ('-st'), suggesting that there was some amount or occurrence of thunder during a night that also had lightning flashes."
