  "context": "The word 'unustanud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'unustama', which means 'to forget'. In English, this corresponds to the perfect tense forms like 'have forgotten', 'forgot', or simply 'forgotten'. It indicates that the forgetting action has been completed in the past. The word can be used with different subjects (I have forgotten, he/she/it has forgotten, etc.) and is commonly used in everyday Estonian to express memory loss regarding something specific."
