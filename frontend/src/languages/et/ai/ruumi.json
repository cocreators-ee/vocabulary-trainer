  "context": "In Estonian, 'ruumi' is the genitive case form of the word 'ruum', which means 'space'. It refers to the concept of physical space or room. In philosophical contexts, it's often discussed as an a priori category - a fundamental form of human cognition through which we organize sensory experience. The word appears in Kantian philosophy discussions where it's considered one of the innate structures of consciousness that allows us to perceive objects spatially."
