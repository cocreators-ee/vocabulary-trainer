  "context": "The word 'toimunud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'tulema', meaning 'to take place' or 'to occur'. It describes something that has already happened and been completed. In English, this corresponds to perfect tense constructions using 'has/have taken place', 'has/have occurred', or 'has/have happened'. The word is commonly used to describe events, activities, or situations in the past that are now considered complete."
