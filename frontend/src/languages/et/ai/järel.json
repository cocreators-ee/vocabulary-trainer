  "context": "The Estonian word 'järel' is a versatile postposition with multiple meanings. It can indicate physical position behind someone or something (spatially), temporal sequence after an event, order/ranking in competitions, result/remainder of something, and even act as an adverb meaning later or subsequently. It commonly appears in genitive case constructions following nouns to express these relationships."
