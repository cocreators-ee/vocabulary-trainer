  "context": "The Estonian word 'sõnul' is an adessive case form of the pronoun 'tema' (he/she). It means 'according to him/her' or 'in his/her words'. This grammatical case indicates location on something, but with pronouns it's commonly used for expressing whose opinion or statement is being referred to. The word appears in contexts where someone is reporting what another person has said or thinks."
