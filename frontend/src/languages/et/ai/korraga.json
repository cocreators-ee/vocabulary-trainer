  "context": "Korraga is an Estonian adverb with multiple related meanings. It can mean 'suddenly' or 'abruptly' when describing unexpected events, as in the first example where a loud noise occurred suddenly. It also means 'simultaneously' or 'at the same time' when referring to multiple things happening together, like three men working at once. Additionally, it can mean 'in one go' or 'all at once' when describing completing something without interruption, such as repaying a loan all at once."
