  "context": "The word 'korraga' in Estonian is an adverb that means 'at the same time' or 'simultaneously'. It's formed from the word 'kord' (meaning 'time' or 'occasion') with the suffix '-ga' which indicates accompaniment or association. This construction literally suggests something happening 'with a time' or in conjunction with itself, hence conveying simultaneity. The word is commonly used to describe actions occurring together or simultaneously."
