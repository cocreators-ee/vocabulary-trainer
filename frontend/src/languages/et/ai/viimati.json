  "context": "The Estonian word 'viimati' is an adverb with multiple meanings. It can mean 'last time' or 'previously' when referring to a past event, as in 'I can't remember the last time I was sick.' It can also mean 'recently' or 'lately' for recent actions or states, such as 'He's been acting kinda strange lately.' Additionally, it can express uncertainty with meanings like 'maybe' or 'possibly' in certain contexts. The word is formed from 'viimane' (last) with the adverbial suffix '-ti'."
