  "context": "The word 'jõulud' is the plural form of 'jõul' and refers to Christmas or the Christmas holiday period in Estonian. It's derived from Proto-Finnic and North Germanic languages, similar to Swedish 'jul' and English 'Yule'. The word functions as a plurale tantum noun (only exists in plural form) in Estonian, which is retained from Old Norse. Jõulud encompasses both the religious celebration of Christ's birth on December 25-27 and the traditional winter solstice period from December 21 to January 7."
