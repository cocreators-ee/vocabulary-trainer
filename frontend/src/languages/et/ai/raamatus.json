  "context": "The Estonian word 'raamatus' is an inessive case form of the noun 'raamat', meaning 'book'. The '-s' ending indicates location within something, so it translates to English as 'in the book' or 'from the book' depending on context. This case is used when indicating that something is located inside a book or when referring to contents originating from a book."
