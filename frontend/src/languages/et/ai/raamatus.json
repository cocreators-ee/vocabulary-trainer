  "context": "The word 'raamatus' is the partitive form of 'raamat', meaning 'in a book' or 'inside a book'. In this context, it appears to be describing decorative initials found within manuscripts and printed books. In older times, these were large ornamental capital letters at the beginning of chapters, sections, or articles that served as both decoration and markers for text divisions."
