  "context": "The word 'telekat' appears to be a colloquial or informal Estonian term related to sitting or staying in one place. Based on the context of the dictionary definitions, it seems to describe a state of being confined, stuck, or required to remain somewhere - like watching TV at home ('Õhtuti sidin kodus ja vahin telekat' means 'In the evening I sat at home and watched TV'). The term appears in contexts where someone is restricted to a particular location, whether voluntarily (watching TV) or involuntarily (being confined somewhere)."
