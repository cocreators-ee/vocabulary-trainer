  "context": "The word 'kirjad' is the plural form of 'kiri', which means letters or mail in Estonian. It refers to written communications sent through postal services, personal correspondence between people. The suffix '-d' indicates plurality in Estonian, so while 'kiri' would be a single letter, 'kirjad' represents multiple letters or mail items."
