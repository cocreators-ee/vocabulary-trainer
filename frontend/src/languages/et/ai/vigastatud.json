  "context": "The Estonian word 'vigastatud' is a past participle form of the verb 'vigastada' (to injure/damage). It describes something that has been injured, wounded, or damaged. This adjective form is commonly used in medical contexts to describe injuries sustained by people, but can also refer to objects that have been damaged. The word combines the root 'viga' (fault/defect/injury) with the suffix '-tatud' indicating completion of an action."
