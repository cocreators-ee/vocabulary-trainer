  "context": "The Estonian word 'kandma' is a verb that means to wear, carry, or bear something. It can refer to physically wearing clothing or accessories (like clothes, shoes, jewelry), carrying objects (like bags, packages), or metaphorically bearing responsibilities, burdens, or children. The word changes form depending on the subject and tense - for example 'kannab' is present tense third person singular (he/she/it wears/carries/bears), while 'kandmas' could be part of a compound verb construction meaning 'is wearing'."
