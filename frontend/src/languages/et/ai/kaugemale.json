  "context": "The Estonian phrase 'oma ninast kaugemale' literally means 'further than one's own nose' and is used to advise someone to think beyond their immediate self-interest or narrow perspective. It suggests looking at the broader context, considering long-term consequences rather than short-term gains, and thinking about how actions affect others or larger situations. The phrase implies a lack of foresight when someone only focuses on themselves without considering bigger implications."
