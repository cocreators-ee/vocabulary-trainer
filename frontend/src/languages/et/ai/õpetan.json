  "context": "The word 'õpetan' appears to be a form of the Estonian verb that means to grind or clench teeth, often expressing anger or frustration. It's used when someone is angry and grinds their teeth together tightly. In the example sentence, it's used in the phrase 'Ma sind veel õpetan!' which translates to 'I'll still teach you!' but implies a threat of punishment or retribution through clenched teeth."
