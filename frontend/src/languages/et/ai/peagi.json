  "context": "The Estonian word 'peagi' is an adverb that means 'soon' or 'shortly'. It's formed from the root word 'pea' (head) combined with '-gi' (also/too). The word indicates that something will happen in the near future, but not immediately. In English translations, it corresponds to words like 'soon', 'shortly', or 'in a little while'. Examples show its usage: 'Peagi tuleb kevad' means 'Spring is coming soon', 'Esimene õhin vaibus peagi' means 'The first snow disappeared soon', and 'Küll ta tuleb peagi tagasi' means 'Surely he will come back soon'."
