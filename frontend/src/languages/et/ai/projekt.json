  "context": "The Estonian word 'projekt' is a loanword from English that means project. It refers to a planned piece of work, especially one that is done over a period of time and designed to achieve something specific or produce something new. In Estonian grammar, it's typically used in the same grammatical contexts as the English word, though may follow Estonian case rules when inflected."
