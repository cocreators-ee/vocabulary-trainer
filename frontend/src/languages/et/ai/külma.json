  "context": "The word 'külma' is the partitive case form of the Estonian adjective 'kümne' (meaning cold). In Estonian grammar, the partitive case has multiple functions, including indicating partialness, duration, or specification. When used with weather descriptions like 'külm ilm' (cold weather), the partitive form can indicate ongoing state or characteristic temperature. It's commonly used to describe chilly conditions that are felt continuously rather than as a single event."
