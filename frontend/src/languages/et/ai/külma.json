  "context": "Külma is the genitive/partitive/illative singular form of the Estonian adjective 'külm' which means cold. It can be used to describe temperature or describe something as being in a state of coldness. In the context shown, it appears to also have an idiomatic meaning where 'külma ei ole' means 'it doesn't matter' or 'one is indifferent', suggesting that when someone says they are neither hot nor cold (külm), it implies complete indifference or apathy."
