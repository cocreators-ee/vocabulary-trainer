  "context": "Meeldima is an Estonian verb that means 'to like' or 'to enjoy'. It's used to express a preference for something or someone. The verb can be conjugated in different forms depending on the subject: mul meeldib (I like), sulle meeldib (you like), tal ei meeldi (he/she doesn't like). It often appears with the dative case pronoun indicating who is doing the liking (mul = for me, sulle = for you, etc.)."
