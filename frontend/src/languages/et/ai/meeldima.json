  "context": "The Estonian verb 'meeldima' means 'to like' in English. It's used with what would be the subject in English (the person who likes something) in the allative case, and what would be the object in English (thing being liked) in the nominative case. So literally, instead of saying 'I like new things,' Estonians say 'New things are pleasing to me' - 'Mulle meeldivad uued asjad'. The verb can express liking for people, objects, activities, or situations."
