  "context": "The Estonian word 'kaugel' is an adverb that means 'far away' or 'at a distance'. It indicates a significant separation in space. This form appears to be the elative case (from where?) of the root word 'kauge', meaning far/distant. In the examples, it's used to describe locations that are distant from the speaker or reference point."
