  "context": "The word 'kauaks' is an Estonian adverb derived from 'kauge' (distant/far). It's the illative case form of 'kaua' (long time/for a long period) and typically means 'for how long', 'until when', or 'for a long time'. In questions, it often asks about duration, while in statements it indicates an extended period. The '-ks' suffix transforms the word into the illative case, suggesting movement toward a state of being for that duration."
