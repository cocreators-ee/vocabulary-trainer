  "context": "The word 'alev' refers to a small settlement or town in Estonian that is larger than a village but smaller than a city. It can also refer to the outskirts or suburbs of a larger city. The term often describes places like Märjamaa and Kohila which are categorized as alevs rather than full cities. In compounds, it forms words like 'töölisalev' (workers' town/borough)."
