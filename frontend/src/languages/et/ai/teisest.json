  "context": "The word 'teisest' is an Estonian partitive case form of 'teine', which means 'other', 'second', or 'another'. It's used to indicate the second item in a sequence, or something different from what was previously mentioned. The partitive case in Estonian often indicates partialness or indefiniteness, and when combined with ordinal numbers like 'teine' (second), it helps specify which particular instance is being referred to."
