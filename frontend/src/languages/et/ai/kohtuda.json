  "context": "The word 'kohtuda' is an Estonian verb that means to meet or encounter someone. It's commonly used when arranging meetings with friends, family, or colleagues. The verb changes form depending on the subject and tense - in present tense it becomes 'kohtub' for third person singular (he/she meets), and can also appear in other conjugated forms like 'kohtume' (we meet) or questions like 'kas te olete kunagi kohtunud?' (have you ever met?)."
