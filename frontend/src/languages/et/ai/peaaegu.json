  "context": "The Estonian word 'peaaegu' is an adverb that means 'almost' or 'nearly'. It is used to indicate that something is very close to happening or being true, but not quite there yet. For example, if someone says 'Ma olen peaaegu valmis', they mean 'I am almost ready' - they are nearly prepared but not completely finished."
