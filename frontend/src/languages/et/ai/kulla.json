  "context": "In Estonian, 'kulla' is a term of endearment used to address someone affectionately. It's similar to English terms like 'sweetie', 'darling', or 'honey'. The word can be used between romantic partners but also more broadly as a friendly term of affection. It derives from the word 'kulda' (to melt) and conveys warmth and tenderness in relationships."
