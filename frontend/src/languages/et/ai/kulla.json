  "context": "Kulla is an informal term of endearment used to address someone affectionately. It functions as an indeclinable adjective and can be translated to English terms like 'dear,' 'sweetie,' or 'honey.' According to the dictionary definition, it's often used not so much in a tender way but rather to express flirtation or humility, or to soften statements. The word is commonly used when addressing girls, women, boys, men, friends, and even strangers in various contexts. It's important to note that 'kulla' can also be the genitive singular form of 'kuld' (gold), though this appears less common as an endearment."
