  "context": "The Estonian word 'nimed' means 'names' but in this context, it specifically refers to entries or listings of names in an honor book (auraamat). An honor book is a special album or register where the achievements and accomplishments of collective groups are recorded, including the names of outstanding members and their photographs. This could include city/village honor books or school records for medal-winning graduates."
