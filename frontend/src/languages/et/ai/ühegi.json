  "context": "The word '端hegi' is an Estonian negative pronoun that functions similarly to the English word 'any' in negative contexts. It's typically used with negative verbs (like 'ei') or questions, and it negates existence or possibility - essentially meaning 'not any' or 'none at all'. This word follows Estonian grammar patterns where pronominal forms often change based on case and context."
