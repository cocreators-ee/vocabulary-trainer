  "context": "The Estonian word 'rõõmuga' is an adverbial form that means 'with joy' or 'happily'. It's formed from the noun 'rõõm' (joy) with the ending '-ga', which in Estonian indicates accompaniment or instrumentality, similar to English 'with'. This construction shows how joy accompanies an action - someone is doing something with happiness or joy."
