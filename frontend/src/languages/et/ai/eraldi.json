  "context": "The Estonian word 'eraldi' is an adverb that means separately, apart, or individually. It indicates that something exists or happens in a separate way from other things, not combined with others. It's commonly used to describe physical separation (sitting separately), having one's own space (separate room), or being treated as an individual rather than part of a group."
