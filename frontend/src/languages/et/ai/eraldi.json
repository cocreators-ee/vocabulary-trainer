  "context": "The Estonian word 'eraldi' is an adverb that means separately, apart, or individually. It indicates that something exists or happens independently from others, not together with them. The dictionary definition explains it as 'separate from others, different from others; in a different place than others'. The antonym is 'koos' (together). Common collocations include phrases like 'eraldi tulema' (to come separately), 'eraldi istuma' (to sit separately), and 'eraldi töötama' (to work separately)."
