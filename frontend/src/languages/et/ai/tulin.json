  "context": "The word 'tulin' is the Estonian first-person singular past tense form of the verb 'tulla', meaning 'to come'. In this context, it's used in sentences where someone has just arrived or recently returned somewhere. For example, 'Tulin alles töölt' means 'I came home from work just now/recently'. The word appears to be part of a phrase where 'alles' modifies the timing aspect of the arrival."
