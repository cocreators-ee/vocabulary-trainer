  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõpuni' is an adverb that means completely, fully, or to the very end. It indicates doing something thoroughly or reaching a complete state without holding back. This word modifies verbs to express that an action is carried out to its fullest extent or conclusion. For example, when someone says they've read a book 'lõpuni', it means they have read it completely from beginning to end."
