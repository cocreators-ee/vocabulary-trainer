  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõpuni' is an adverb that means 'to the end', 'completely', or 'fully'. It's formed from the root word 'lõpp' (end) with the suffix '-ni' indicating direction or completion. This word is used to express that something should be carried out thoroughly, completely, until its natural conclusion."
