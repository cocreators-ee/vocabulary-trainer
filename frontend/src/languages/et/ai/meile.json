  "context": "The word 'meile' is the allative plural form of 'me' (we). It indicates motion toward or direction to the speaker and others. In Estonian, this case shows where something goes or who receives action. It's commonly used with verbs like 'tulla' (to come), 'minna' (to go), 'jääda' (to remain) to indicate movement toward the group."
