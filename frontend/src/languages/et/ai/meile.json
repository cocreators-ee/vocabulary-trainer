  "context": "The Estonian word 'meile' is the allative case of 'meie', meaning 'we/us'. In allative case, it indicates motion toward or direction to 'us', so it can be translated as 'to us' or 'for us' depending on context. It's commonly used when someone is coming to visit us, something is being sent to us, or an action is directed toward us."
