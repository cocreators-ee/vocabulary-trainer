  "context": "The word 'arvan' is the first-person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'arvama'. It means 'I think', 'I believe', or 'I guess'. This form is used when expressing one's opinion, assumption, or belief about something that may not be completely certain. The dictionary definitions show it can mean to consider something probable or believable, to have a subjective conviction about something, to make an estimate or guess, and even to plan or intend in some contexts."
