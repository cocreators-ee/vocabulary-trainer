  "context": "In Estonian, 'homo' is a loanword from English that means 'gay' or 'homosexual'. It's commonly used in modern Estonian to refer to homosexual people. The word doesn't change form based on gender in this context, unlike some other Estonian words that have masculine and feminine forms. Note that while it has the same spelling as the English word 'homo', its meaning is specifically about sexual orientation rather than biological sex."
