  "context": "The Estonian word 'veidi' is an adverb that means 'a little', 'somewhat', or 'slightly'. It's used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to indicate a small degree or quantity. For example, it can express slight fatigue ('veidi v채sinud'), a modest improvement in results ('veidi paremini tulemus'), or a short delay ('veidi aega'). The word is commonly used in everyday Estonian conversation to convey that something is just a bit of what's being described."
