  "context": "The Estonian word 'alles' is an adverb that indicates something has happened very recently, not until a certain time, or only just occurred. It can express temporal immediacy or delay, similar to English expressions like 'just now', 'only just', 'not until', or 'yet'. In questions, it often means 'still needed/required'."
