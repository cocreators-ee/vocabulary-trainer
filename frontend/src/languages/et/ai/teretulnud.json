  "context": "The word 'teretulnud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'tulla' (to come) combined with 'tere' (good/pleasant). It literally means 'come well' and serves as a warm greeting or welcome. This form is commonly used to express hospitality and make someone feel welcomed in a place or situation. The word can be used both formally and informally, similar to how we use 'welcome' in English."
