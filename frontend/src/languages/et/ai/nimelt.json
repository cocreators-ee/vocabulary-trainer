  "context": "The Estonian word 'nimelt' is an adverb that has three main functions: 1) as an emphatic particle meaning 'just', 'exactly', or 'precisely' to emphasize something; 2) used when presenting clarifications, explanations, or additional remarks (similar to 'namely'); and 3) as an intensive meaning 'intentionally', 'purposefully', or 'deliberately'. It can function as a discourse marker that highlights exactness or serves to introduce specific details or examples."
