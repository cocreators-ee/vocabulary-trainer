  "context": "The Estonian word 'nimelt' is an adverb that means 'by name', 'named', or 'called'. It's used to specify someone's name or identity, often in contexts like introducing someone, asking for identification, or referring to a specific person by their name. The word derives from 'nimi' (name) and the suffix '-lt' indicating ablative case."
