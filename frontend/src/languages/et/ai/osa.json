  "context": "In Estonian, 'osa' is a versatile word with multiple meanings. It can refer to a physical part or component of something (like a machine's parts), a division or section of a larger whole (like chapters in a book), a share or portion allocated to someone, or a role in a performance. It's also used as a postposition meaning 'concerning' or 'in relation to'. The word can be modified with case endings for different grammatical functions - for example, 'osas' means 'in part' or 'partly', while 'osale' means 'to a part'."
