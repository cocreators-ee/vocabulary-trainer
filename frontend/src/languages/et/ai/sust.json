  "context": "The word 'sust' is the elative singular form of the Estonian pronoun 'sa' (you). In English grammar, this would correspond to cases where we use prepositions like 'from', 'out of', or 'away from' when referring to someone. This case indicates movement away from a person or source. The word is used unstressed in sentences; when stressed, the longer form 'sinust' is used instead."
