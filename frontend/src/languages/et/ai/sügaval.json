  "context": "The Estonian word 'sügaval' is an adverb that means deeply or profoundly. It modifies verbs to indicate intensity, depth of feeling, or physical distance. It can be used for both emotional states (like being in deep trouble) and physical descriptions (like a deep night). The '-l' ending indicates it's in the adessive case, showing manner or how something is done."
