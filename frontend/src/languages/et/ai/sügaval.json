  "context": "In Estonian, 'sügaval' is an adverb that means 'deeply' or 'far below the surface'. It's used to describe something located significantly below a surface level or in depth. For example, it can refer to things being buried deeply in earth, water levels being deep, or even metaphorical depths like working deep underground or having profound thoughts. The word modifies verbs or locations to emphasize the significant depth of where something is situated."
