  "context": "The word 'nägudeni' is an Estonian adverb that means 'until (we) see faces' or 'until face-to-face'. It's derived from the noun 'nägu' (face) and the suffix '-deni' which indicates direction or limit, similar to English '-ward' or '-to'. The word implies meeting in person or seeing someone directly rather than communicating remotely. This is a common expression used when parting ways with someone you'll see again in person, emphasizing that you will meet face-to-face at some point."
