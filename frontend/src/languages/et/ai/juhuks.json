  "context": "The word 'juhuks' is an Estonian adverb that means 'in case' or 'just in case'. It's used to express precaution, suggesting something might happen and it's good to be prepared. The word derives from 'juhus' (chance/opportunity) but here functions as a prepositional phrase to indicate purpose of preparation for a possible future event."
