  "context": "The Estonian word 'taga' is highly versatile and can function as an adverb, postposition, or part of compound verbs. As an adverb, it means 'at the back' (e.g., 'Ta on kõige taga' - He's at the back). As a postposition governing genitive case, it means 'behind' (e.g., 'Maja taga on suur põld' - There's a big field behind the house). It also appears in many compound verbs where it can indicate following someone/something (e.g., 'Koer ajas kassi taga' - The dog chased the cat), being late ('Kell paar minutit taga'), or seeking something ('Ajab raha taga' - Chases after money)."
