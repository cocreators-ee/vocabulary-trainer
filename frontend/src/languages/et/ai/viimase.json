  "context": "The phrase 'viimase tuhande peal' is an Estonian idiom that literally translates to 'on top of the last thousand.' It has two main meanings: 1) being in a critical or worn-out state, near exhaustion or deterioration (like shoes wearing out), and 2) barely managing or succeeding with difficulty. The phrase suggests something has reached its limit or is just hanging on by a thread."
