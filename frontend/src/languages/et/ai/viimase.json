  "context": "The word 'viimase' is the partitive case form of 'viimane', which means 'last' or 'final'. In Estonian, adjectives change their endings based on the grammatical case. The partitive case (-se ending) is used to indicate partiality, indefiniteness, or when referring to a quantity of something. So 'viimase' specifically refers to 'the last one (of many)' or 'a final instance' rather than definitively 'the very last'."
