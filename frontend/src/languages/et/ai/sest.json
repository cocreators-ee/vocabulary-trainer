  "context": "'Sest' is an Estonian conjunction used to introduce a clause that gives the reason or cause for something mentioned in the main clause. It functions similarly to 'because' in English and is one of the most common ways to express causation in Estonian. The word can also appear as part of the compound form 'sest et' (meaning 'because that' or 'since')."
