  "context": "The Estonian word 'pinnale' is an adessive case form of 'pinna', meaning 'surface'. It indicates movement or placement onto a surface. The '-le' ending in Estonian typically shows destination or location, similar to English prepositions like 'onto', 'to the top of', or 'up to'. This word is commonly used when referring to something reaching or being placed on a physical surface."
