  "context": "The word 'rääkis' is the third-person singular past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'rääkima', which means 'to speak', 'to talk', or 'to say'. It specifically refers to someone speaking in the past tense. In English, this would translate as 'spoke' or 'said' when referring to a male or unspecified speaker. For example, if you wanted to say 'He spoke yesterday', you would use 'rääkis eile' in Estonian."
