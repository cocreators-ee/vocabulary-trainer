  "context": "The word 'veidike' in Estonian is a diminutive form of the adjective/particle 'veider', which means strange, odd or peculiar. As a diminutive ending '-ke' is added, it suggests something small-scale but still has that quality of strangeness or peculiarity. It's often used to describe places or things that are unusual in some way, often with a slightly positive or neutral connotation rather than negative. The word can be translated as 'strange place', 'odd place' or 'peculiar location'. It typically refers to small-scale strange phenomena or locations rather than massive or serious oddities."
