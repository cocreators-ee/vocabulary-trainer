  "context": "The Estonian word 'põhjas' is an adverb that literally means 'north' but in this context it's used idiomatically to mean someone has no money - they are completely out of cash. It's similar to English expressions like being 'flat broke' or having their pockets empty. The expression comes from the idea of having nothing left, just as there's nothing beyond the north pole (the end of the world in ancient beliefs)."
