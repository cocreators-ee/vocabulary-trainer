  "context": "The Estonian word 'perse' is a vulgar slang term that literally means 'buttocks' or 'bottom', but it's commonly used as an insult similar to the English words 'asshole', 'jerk', or 'idiot'. It's considered quite offensive and informal. In example sentences, it can be used to describe someone as unpleasant (e.g., 'He is such a jerk'), express frustration with someone's behavior (e.g., 'Why are you being such an idiot?'), or describe a difficult situation (e.g., 'It was a really shitty day')."
