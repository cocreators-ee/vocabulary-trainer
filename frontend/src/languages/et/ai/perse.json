  "context": "The Estonian word 'perse' is a vulgar term referring to the buttocks or anus. It's considered offensive language and used in both literal references to body parts and as strong insults. The word has various declension forms including genitive 'persse', partitive 'perset', and plural forms like 'perssed'. In addition to its anatomical meaning, it appears in idiomatic expressions such as 'mine pers!' (go to hell!) and is used as an insult similar to English 'asshole' or stronger profanities."
