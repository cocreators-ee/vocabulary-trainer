  "context": "The Estonian word 'neitsi' has two main meanings: 1) A virgin (a girl or woman who has not had sexual intercourse), often with connotations of purity and innocence; it can also be used archaically to simply mean a young girl or maiden. 2) In an older usage, it refers to a maid or servant girl. The word is commonly used in compound words like 'merineitsi' (maiden of the sea/mermaid), 'pruutneitsi' (bridesmaid), and 'vesineitsi' (water maiden)."
