  "context": "Tulnud is the past participle of the Estonian verb 'tulla' meaning 'to come'. It indicates that someone or something has arrived at a destination. This form is often used with the auxiliary verb 'olema' (to be) in compound tenses, such as 'olen tulnud' (I have come) or 'on tulnud' (he/she/it has come). The word can also function adjectivally to describe someone who has arrived."
