  "context": "The word 'tulnud' is the past active participle of the Estonian verb 'tulema', which means 'to come'. As a participle, it functions as an adjective and can mean 'come', 'arrived', or more metaphorically 'appeared' or 'emerged'. It's often used to describe something that has come into being or arrived from somewhere. In the example given in the dictionary definition, it's used in the phrase 'nõelasilmast tulnud' which literally means 'come from the eye of a needle', but is an idiom meaning something modern, newfangled, or recently emerged."
