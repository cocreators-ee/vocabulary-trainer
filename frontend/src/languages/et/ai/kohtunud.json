  "context": "The word 'kohtunud' appears to be the past tense of 'kohtuma' (to meet) in Estonian. However, looking at the context from the dictionary definitions provided, it seems there might be some confusion or the word is being used in a specific context with the related concept 'hingeline'. Based on the example sentences shown where 'kohtunud' appears alongside 'hingelised', this could refer to encountering or meeting living/animated beings. The word 'kohtunud' itself means 'met' in Estonian, referring to the past tense of the verb 'to meet'."
