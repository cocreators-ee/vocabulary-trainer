  "context": "The Estonian word 'küla' primarily means 'village' referring to a small settlement or community of people. It can also be used as an adverbial form meaning 'to visit someone' - when in the inessive case 'külas' it means someone visited you, and in the illative case 'külalla' it means you went to visit someone. This word has multiple compound forms indicating different types of villages (ahelküla, hajaküla, ridaküla, etc.) and is commonly used both geographically and socially in Estonian."
