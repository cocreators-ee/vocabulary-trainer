  "context": "The word 'tegemas' is the partitive case form of the verb 'tegema' (to do/make). It appears to be used in contexts where someone is engaged in some activity or action. While I see that 'kaasas' means 'with' or 'accompanying', and there are examples showing this usage, the specific word 'tegemas' seems to indicate an ongoing action - being in the process of doing something. It's commonly used with prepositions like 'koos' (together) to indicate collaborative activities."
