  "context": "The Estonian word 'tuttav' has two main meanings: as a noun, it refers to an acquaintance or someone you know personally; as an adjective, it means familiar or well-known. The word can be used for both people and objects/places that are known to you through prior experience. It comes from the root 'tundma' meaning 'to know'. In plural form, it becomes 'tuttavad', indicating multiple acquaintances or things that are familiar."
