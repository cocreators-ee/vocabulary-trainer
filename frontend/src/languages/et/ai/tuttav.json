  "context": "The Estonian word 'tuttav' is a noun that refers to an acquaintance or someone you recognize but aren't necessarily close friends with. It can be used in singular form (tuttav) for one person, plural form (tutvad) for multiple people, and has the genitive case form 'tuttava'. The word conveys familiarity rather than intimacy - it's less personal than 'sõber' (friend)."
