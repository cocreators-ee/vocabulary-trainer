  "context": "The word 'autosid' is the partitive plural form of 'auto' (car) in Estonian. In the partitive case, it indicates an unspecified quantity or incomplete action related to cars. It can refer to multiple cars without specifying exactly how many, and is often used when talking about actions performed on cars like dismantling, selling, or repairing them. The dictionary definition mentions a workshop where autosid are dismantled and their usable parts are traded."
