  "context": "The word 'autosid' is the partitive form of 'auto' (car/vehicle) in Estonian. The partitive case is used to indicate partialness or indefiniteness, and is commonly used with numbers less than one or when referring to objects in a general sense without specifying exact quantity. In this plural form, it would typically be used when talking about some cars or vehicles, but not all of them."
