  "context": "The Estonian word 'saavad' is the third-person plural present indicative form of the verb 'saama', which means 'to get' or 'to obtain'. In English, it translates to forms like 'they get', 'they obtain', 'they receive', or 'they become'. This form indicates that multiple subjects (third person plural) are currently in the process of getting something or becoming something. For example, 'saavad lapsed kooli jõudsid' would mean 'the children get to school' or 'the children reach school'. The word can indicate possession, achievement, arrival, or transformation depending on the context."
