  "context": "The Estonian word 'torm' primarily means a storm - a very strong wind with meteorological criteria (wind force greater than 9 on the Beaufort scale). It can also metaphorically refer to powerful emotions, social upheavals, or rapid, uncontrolled behavior. The word has various compound forms like 'sügisetorm' (autumn storm), 'revolutsioonitorm' (revolutionary storm), and 'pahameeletorm' (storm of anger)."
