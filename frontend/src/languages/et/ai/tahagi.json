  "context": "In Estonian, 'tahagi' is a conjugated form of the verb 'tahtma' (to want/wish). It appears to be in the 3rd person singular present tense form 'tahtub' or possibly part of another construction. The word expresses desire or wishing for something. In the example sentences provided, we see different forms of the root concept: 'tahaksin' (I would like), 'tahame' (we want), and 'tahab' (he/she wants)."
