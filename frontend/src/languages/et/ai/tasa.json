  "context": "In Estonian, 'tasa' is primarily an adverb with multiple related meanings. It can mean 'quietly' or softly when describing speech or actions made without noise (like whispering or speaking in a low voice). It also means 'evenly' or 'even' when referring to things that move at a steady pace, happen gradually, or are level/without variation. Additionally, it can describe gentle or subtle actions performed lightly without force. The word doesn't change form as it's often used in its base adverbial form."
