  "context": "The Estonian word 'sina' is the second-person singular pronoun used for addressing someone informally, similar to 'you' in English but specifically for a single person you have a familiar relationship with. It's the informal form of address, as opposed to 'teie' which is the formal/plural form. In Estonian, verb conjugation changes based on whether you're using 'sina' or another pronoun."
