  "context": "In Estonian, 'eri' is an adjective that means 'different', 'various', or 'separate'. It's used to indicate distinction between things or people. The word doesn't change form in different cases but can be combined with various suffixes to create related concepts like 'eriline' (special) or 'eraldada' (to separate)."
