  "context": "The Estonian word 'sisse' is a postposition that indicates movement into something, direction towards the inside, or entering a space. It governs the genitive case and can be used literally to indicate physical entry (like going into a room) or figuratively (like entering a situation). In compound verbs, it forms inseparable units with various main verbs to express concepts such as entering, including, investing, or becoming involved in something."
