  "context": "The Estonian word 'k체ll' is a common affirmative response that functions similarly to English words like 'yes', 'indeed', or 'of course'. It's used to confirm agreement, acknowledge truthfulness, or express certainty. In conversation, it often serves as a standalone response to questions or statements. The word can also appear in different positions within sentences and may be emphasized for stronger affirmation."
