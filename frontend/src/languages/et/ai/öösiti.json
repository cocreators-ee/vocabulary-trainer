  "context": "The word 'öösiti' is an Estonian adverb that indicates something happening during nighttime hours. It's formed from the root word 'öö' (night) with the suffix '-s-', which typically denotes time or manner, and ending in '-i', which makes it an adverb. The word conveys action occurring late at night or overnight rather than specifically midnight."
