  "context": "The word 'pead' is the genitive singular form of 'pea', which means 'head'. In Estonian, it can also be used to refer to a leader or boss in certain contexts. The word appears to be in the genitive case (possessive/attributive form), indicating possession or relationship - as in 'his head' or 'of the head'. It's important to note that 'pead' specifically refers to one head, not multiple heads."
