  "context": "The Estonian word 'alasti' is an adverb that means 'naked' or 'bare'. It describes being without clothes, having a bare body. This can be used literally for people (without clothing) and metaphorically for abstract concepts (unadorned, unvarnished). The dictionary shows it can also describe trees/plants without leaves or objects without covering."
