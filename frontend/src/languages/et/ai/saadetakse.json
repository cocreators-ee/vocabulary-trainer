  "context": "The word 'saadetakse' is the 3rd person singular present tense passive form of the Estonian verb 'saada' (to send). It indicates that something is being sent or will be sent, with no specific agent performing the action. This is a common construction in Estonian for describing actions where the doer is unknown, unimportant, or not specified."
