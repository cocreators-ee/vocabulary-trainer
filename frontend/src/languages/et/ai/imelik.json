  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'imelik' describes something that is strange, weird, odd, or unusual in a distinctive way. It can be used to describe people, objects, situations, or phenomena that stand out from the norm because of their peculiarity or uniqueness. The word carries a neutral tone but conveys a sense of being noteworthy due to its differentness from what one would normally expect."
