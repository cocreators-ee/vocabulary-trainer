  "context": "The word 'tibi' in Estonian is an informal and sometimes slightly condescending term for a young woman or girl. It can be used affectionately, but also carries a nuance of immaturity or naiveté. It’s similar to ‘lass’ or ‘chick’ in English, and should be used with caution as it can be considered disrespectful depending on the context."
