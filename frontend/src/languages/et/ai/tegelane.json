  "context": "In Estonian, 'tegelane' refers to a character in a story, play, movie, or other narrative work. It can be the main protagonist, supporting characters, or any person who appears in the fictional world and has some role in the plot. The word comes from the verb 'tulema' (to come/do) with the '-ane' suffix indicating an agent or doer - essentially someone who 'does' things in the narrative."
