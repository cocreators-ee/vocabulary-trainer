  "context": "The Estonian word 'tegelane' has multiple meanings. It can refer to 1) an active person involved in some field or public life (a public figure), 2) a character in literature, film, or theater, and 3) colloquially, it can mean a guy, fellow, or type of person. The word derives from 'tegema' (to do) + '-lane' (person suffix), indicating someone who does or acts in a particular area."
