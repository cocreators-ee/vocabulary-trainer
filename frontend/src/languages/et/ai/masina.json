  "context": "The Estonian word 'masina' is a noun that can refer to either a car or any type of machine. It's the general term for mechanical devices, though it most commonly refers to automobiles in everyday usage. The word doesn't change form based on gender since Estonian doesn't have grammatical gender. In different contexts, it could mean anything from a simple tool to a complex industrial machine."
