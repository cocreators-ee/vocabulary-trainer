  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunne' is versatile with multiple meanings: 1) Physical sensation or feeling (like pain or emptiness in the throat), 2) Emotional state or mood (happiness, sadness, etc.), and 3) Intuitive sense or instinct. It can refer to both physical sensations and emotional states, as well as a person's intuitive awareness of something. In compound words, it often appears with other nouns to specify types of feelings (e.g., valu-tunne = pain feeling)."
