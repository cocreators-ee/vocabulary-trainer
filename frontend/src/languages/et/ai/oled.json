  "context": "The Estonian word 'oled' is the second-person singular present indicative form of the verb 'olema', which means 'to be'. It translates to English as 'you are' or simply 'are' when used in sentences. This form is used when addressing one person directly (singular) in the present tense. The word belongs to the category of auxiliary verbs and is fundamental for constructing many sentence structures in Estonian."
