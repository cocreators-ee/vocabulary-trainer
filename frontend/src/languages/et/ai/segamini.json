  "context": "The Estonian word 'segamini' is an adverb that describes a state of being confused, disorganized, or in a mess. It's derived from the root word 'sega-' (meaning mixed) and the suffix '-mini', indicating a resulting state. When someone is 'segamini', they are unable to think clearly or organize their thoughts/actions properly. This word can be used to describe both mental confusion ('Ta on segamini omaenda töödega' - He is confused about his own work) and physical disorganization ('Lapsed jooksid segamini pargis' - The children were running around in a mess/disorganized way in the park)."
