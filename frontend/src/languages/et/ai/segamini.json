  "context": "In Estonian, 'segamini' is an adverb that describes something being in a state of disorder or confusion. It can refer to physical mess (things being scattered and not organized), mental confusion (not having one's thoughts together), or things being mixed together improperly. The word comes from the root 'sega-' meaning 'mixed' plus '-mini' forming an adverbial form."
