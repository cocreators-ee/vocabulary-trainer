  "context": "The Estonian word 'tegelikult' is an adverb that means 'actually', 'in fact', or 'really'. It's used to emphasize the truth of a statement or to introduce something that might be contrary to expectations. The word comes from 'tegelik' meaning 'real' or 'actual' with the '-lt' suffix forming an adverb. In Estonian, it often appears at the beginning, middle, or end of sentences depending on what aspect is being emphasized."
