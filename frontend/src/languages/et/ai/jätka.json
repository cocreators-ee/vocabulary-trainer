  "context": "The Estonian word 'jätka' is an imperative/present tense form meaning 'continue' or 'proceed'. It's derived from the verb 'jätkama'. In context, it can be used as a command telling someone to continue what they're doing or as a statement that something continues. The dictionary shows it appears in phrases like 'jätka tööd' (continue working), and it's often used with direction words like 'sealt, kuhu töö pooleli jäi' (from where the work was left unfinished)."
