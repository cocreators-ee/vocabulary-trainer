  "context": "\"Hinga\" is an Estonian imperative verb meaning \"breathe\" or \"inhale.\" It's used in commands and instructions. In the provided context, it appears with \"mitte\" (meaning \"don't\" or \"not\") to give a negative command: \"Don't breathe through your mouth, but through your nose!\" This is part of a larger grammatical construction where Estonian uses specific verb forms for imperative statements."
