  "context": "The word 'noh' is a common discourse marker or interjection in Estonian. It's used to fill pauses, express hesitation, or introduce something new in conversation. Similar to English words like 'well', 'then', or 'so', it helps connect thoughts and makes speech more natural. It often appears at the beginning of sentences to indicate the speaker is thinking or about to say something."
