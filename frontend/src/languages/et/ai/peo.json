  "context": "The word 'peo' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'pidu', which means a party, celebration, or social gathering. In this case, it would be translated as 'of the party' or 'belonging to the party'. For example: 'Tule meie peole!' means 'Come to our party!', where 'peole' is the allative case form meaning 'to the party'."
