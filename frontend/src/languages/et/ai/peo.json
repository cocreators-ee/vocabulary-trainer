  "context": "The word 'peo' in Estonian primarily means 'palm of the hand' or simply 'hand'. It's the inner part of the hand between fingers and wrist. This word is commonly used in various contexts where reference to the palm or hand is needed, such as holding something in one's hand giving something from hand to hand, or describing physical actions involving hands. In Estonian grammar, it can function both as a noun and sometimes adverbially meaning 'by hand' or 'directly'."
