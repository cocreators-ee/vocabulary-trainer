It can refer to physical perfection, moral ideals, or optimal conditions. The word is derived from the international root 'ide-' and carries similar connotations across contexts - it may describe a person's behavior as perfectly appropriate, a solution as ideally suited to solve a problem, or conditions as being perfectly suitable for some purpose."
