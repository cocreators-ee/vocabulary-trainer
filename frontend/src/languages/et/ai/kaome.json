  "context": "The word 'kaome' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the verb 'sööma' (to eat) with an imperative/hortative meaning. It functions as a suggestion or invitation to eat together, similar to English expressions like 'let's eat' or 'shall we eat?'. The word includes the subject pronoun 'me' (we) and the present tense ending '-me', but uses the imperative form rather than indicative mood for making a collective proposal."
