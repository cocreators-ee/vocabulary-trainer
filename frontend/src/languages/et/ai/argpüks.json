  "context": "The Estonian word 'argpüks' is a compound noun formed from 'arg' (meaning cowardly/cowardice) and 'püks' (meaning pants). It literally translates to 'coward pants' but functions as a term for a coward or cowardly person. This is an insulting or derogatory term used to describe someone who lacks courage, is timid, or avoids danger. The word follows Estonian noun declension patterns with various case forms like genitive argpüksi and partitive argpüksi."
