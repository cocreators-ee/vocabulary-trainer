  "context": "The Estonian word 'argpüks' is a compound noun formed from 'arg' (timid, cowardly) and 'püks' (trousers/pants). Literally translating to 'coward pants,' it's used as an insult to describe someone who behaves in a cowardly or timid manner. It's similar to English terms like 'coward' or 'chicken' when referring to someone lacking courage."
