  "context": "The Estonian word 'ajal' is an adessive case form of the word 'aeg' (time). It functions as a temporal preposition or adverb meaning 'at the time,' 'during,' or 'when.' This form indicates that something happens at a specific point in time or during a particular period. The adessive case typically shows location on or at, but with time words it marks when an action occurs."
