  "context": "The Estonian word 'juhul' is a preposition or conjunction used to introduce conditional situations. It can be translated as 'in case', 'if', or 'in the event that'. It's commonly used when talking about hypothetical scenarios or conditions, similar to how we use 'just in case' or 'in the event' in English."
