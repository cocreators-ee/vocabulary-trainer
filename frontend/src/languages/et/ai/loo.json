  "context": "In Estonian, 'loo' is part of the compound word 'jutukangelane' (lo+kangelane), which means 'story hero' or 'protagonist'. It appears to be a shortened form that combines with other words, particularly when referring to characters in stories. The dictionary definition confirms this usage, showing it as part of 'jutustuse kangelane' (story's hero). This word is commonly used when discussing literature and narrative characters in Estonian."
