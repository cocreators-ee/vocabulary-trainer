  "context": "The Estonian word 'igatsesin' expresses a deep sense of longing or missing someone or something. It’s more profound than simply saying ‘I miss,’ implying a wistful yearning for a past experience or a person who is absent. In English, it can be translated as 'I missed', 'I longed for', or 'I yearned for'."
