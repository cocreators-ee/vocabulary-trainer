  "context": "The word 'kingitus' is a common Estonian noun meaning 'gift' or 'present'. It's derived from the verb 'kinkima' (to give as a gift) with the suffix '-tus' forming an abstract noun. The declension shows it follows type 11/harjutus pattern in Estonian grammar. Examples of its usage include giving gifts for Christmas ('Jõuluvana jagas kingitusi'), having a small gift for someone ('Mul on sulle väike kingitus'), and receiving something as a gift ('Laps sai kingituseks nuku'). Compounds like 'jõulukingitus' (Christmas gift) are also common in Estonian."
