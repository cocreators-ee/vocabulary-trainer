  "context": "\"Oli\" is the past tense third person singular form of the Estonian verb \"olema\", which means \"to be\". It corresponds to English \"was\" and is used when referring to a single subject in the past. For example, \"Kool oli suur\" means \"The school was big.\" The verb \"olema\" has different forms for different persons and tenses - \"oli\" specifically indicates third person singular (he/she/it) in the simple past tense."
