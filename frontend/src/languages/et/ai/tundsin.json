  "context": "The word 'tundsin' appears to be a form of the Estonian verb 'hingama' which means 'to breathe'. In the first sentence, it's used with 'kergendust' (relief) and translates to 'breathed relief'. The other examples show different forms of 'hingama' where it can mean breathing out or speaking about something. Based on the dictionary definitions, 'hingama' primarily means breathing in and out, but also has extended meanings like spreading something or talking about/disclosing information."
