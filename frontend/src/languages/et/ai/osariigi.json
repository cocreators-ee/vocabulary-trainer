  "context": "The word 'osariigi' is the genitive case form of 'osariik', which means 'state' in English. In Estonian, when we say 'osariigi' (genitive), it indicates possession or relationship to a state - similar to saying 'of the state' or 'belonging to the state'. This form is used when describing things that pertain to a state government or are associated with a particular state in a federal system like the United States. The word structure shows the genitive ending '-i' added to the root 'osariik', which follows Estonian grammatical rules for possession and relationship."
