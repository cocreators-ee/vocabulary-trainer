  "context": "The word 'lõpetatud' is the past participle form of the verb 'lõpetama' (to finish/complete). It describes something that has been completed or finished in the past. The '-tud' ending indicates it's a passive participle, meaning the action was done to the subject rather than by them. This form is commonly used with auxiliary verbs like 'on', 'oli', 'oled', etc., to form compound tenses indicating completed actions."
