It's used as a noun in Estonian with various grammatical forms (genitive video, partitive videot). The word appears in compound words like 'videosalvestatud' (videorecorded) and is commonly used in modern contexts for things like videosignaal (video signal), videofilm (videofilm), or videopöördumine (video call)."
