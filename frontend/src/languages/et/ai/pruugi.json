  "context": "The Estonian word 'pruugi' is used as an auxiliary verb construction meaning 'not necessarily', 'might not', or 'doesn't have to'. It's formed from the verb 'pruukima' (to need/require) in the negative potential form. This construction expresses that something is not required or necessary, and can be omitted without consequences. It often appears with the main verb at the end of the sentence structure."
