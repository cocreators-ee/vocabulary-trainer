  "context": "The Estonian word 'meie' has two main uses: as a first-person plural pronoun meaning 'we', and as a possessive adjective meaning 'our'. In its pronominal form, it refers to the speaker including others (speaker + at least one other person). As a possessive adjective, it shows possession or ownership by the group including the speaker. The word declines in Estonian depending on case and number, but this is the basic nominative singular form."
