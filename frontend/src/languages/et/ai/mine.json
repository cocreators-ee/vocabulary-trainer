  "context": "The word 'mine' is the 1st person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'minema', which means 'to go'. It indicates that the speaker is currently performing the action of going or will be going somewhere. In Estonian, verbs are conjugated based on person and number, so 'mine' specifically refers to 'I go' or 'I am going'. This form would be used when speaking about oneself in present tense."
