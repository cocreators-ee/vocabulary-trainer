  "context": "In Estonian, 'mine' is an adverb expressing doubt or uncertainty in a positive affirmation. It's used to express that something is very possible or likely, similar to saying 'very possibly' or 'probably'. In the example sentence from A.H. Tammsaare, it shows how this expression of doubt is actually confirming possibility."
