  "context": "The Estonian verb 'tahtma' is a versatile word that primarily means 'to want' or 'to desire'. It can express personal wishes, intentions, needs, and sometimes even strong urges. The verb conjugates regularly in Estonian with forms like 'tahan' (I want), 'tahad' (you want), 'tahab' (he/she/it wants), etc. It's used both for concrete desires (wanting food, objects) and abstract concepts (wanting rest, knowledge, success). In some contexts, it can also imply planning or intending to do something, similar to the English word 'plan'."
