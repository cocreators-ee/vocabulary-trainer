  "context": "In Estonian, 'peata' is the abessive singular form of 'pea', which means 'head'. The abessive case indicates absence or lack. So 'peata literally means 'without a head'. It's commonly used metaphorically to describe someone who acts confused, panicked, or disoriented, like a chicken running around without its head after being decapitated."
