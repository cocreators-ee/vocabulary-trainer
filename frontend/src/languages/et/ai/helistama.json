  "context": "The word 'helistama' is an Estonian verb that means to make a phone call or to contact someone by telephone. It's the basic infinitive form of the verb, and it follows standard Estonian conjugation patterns in different tenses and moods. For example, when used with 'ma' (I), it becomes 'helin' (I call), with 'sa' (you) it can be 'helid' or 'helistad' depending on formality, and in future tense constructions like 'Kas sa heliksid?' (Would you call?)."
