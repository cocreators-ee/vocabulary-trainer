  "context": "The Estonian word 'helistama' is a verb that has two main meanings: 1) to make something ring, such as bells or doorbells, and 2) to make a phone call. It's derived from the root 'helis-' which relates to sound/tones and the '-tama' suffix indicating action. The word can be conjugated in various tenses including present (helistan/helistan), past (helistasin), imperative (helista!), etc."
