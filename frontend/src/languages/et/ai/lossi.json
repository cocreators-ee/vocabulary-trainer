  "context": "The word 'lossi' is the illative case form of the Estonian noun 'loss', which means 'castle' or 'palace'. In Estonian grammar, the illative case indicates movement into a place. So 'lossi' specifically means 'into the castle/palace' and would be used when describing someone entering or going to a castle or palace."
