  "context": "The word 'teeks' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'tööma' (to work/do) in third person singular. It means 'would do/make/go' and expresses a hypothetical action that would happen under certain conditions. This is part of the conditional mood used to talk about possible or imagined scenarios rather than real, current actions."
