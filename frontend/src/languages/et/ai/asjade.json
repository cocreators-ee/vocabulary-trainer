  "context": "\"Asjade\" is the genitive plural form of the Estonian noun \"asi,\" which means \"thing.\" In this case, it functions as an object or topic - literally \"of things\" or \"regarding matters.\" The word appears to be used in contexts related to organizing, handling, or dealing with various tasks or matters. This is evident from example sentences where it relates to doing/arranging things and putting all matters in order."
