  "context": "The word 'uurin' appears to be a variant spelling or typo of the interjection 'päh', which is used in Estonian to express contempt, disdain, scorn, or disapproval. It's an exclamation similar to 'ugh' or 'bah' in English, often showing annoyance or disgust toward someone or something. The dictionary definition confirms this usage with multiple example sentences where 'päh' expresses negative feelings or criticism."
