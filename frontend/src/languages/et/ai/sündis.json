  "context": "The word 'sündis' is the past tense (third person singular) of the Estonian verb 'sündima', which means 'to be born' or 'to give birth'. It specifically refers to the event of someone being born. In this case, it's in the simple past tense ('oli') form describing that a birth occurred at some point in the past. The word is commonly used when talking about births of babies but can also refer to other beginnings or origins."
