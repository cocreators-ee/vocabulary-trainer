  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuidagi' is an adverb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'somehow' or 'in some way', expressing uncertainty or vagueness about how something happens. It can also mean 'to some extent' or 'a little bit' when indicating a degree of something. When used with negation (mitte kuidagi), it means 'at all' - absolute negation. The word is versatile and appears frequently in everyday Estonian conversation to modify statements with nuance."
