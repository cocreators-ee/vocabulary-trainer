  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuidagi' is an adverb that expresses uncertainty or indefiniteness, meaning 'somehow', 'in some way', or 'by some means'. It indicates that something happens in a manner that is not clearly specified, often implying difficulty or uncertainty about how it was accomplished. This word combines elements of 'kui' (like/as if) and '-g-' with the adverbial suffix '-i', forming an expression that conveys vagueness about method or manner."
