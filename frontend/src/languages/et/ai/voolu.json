  "context": "The word 'voolu' is the genitive singular form of 'voog', which means 'flow' or 'current'. In electrical contexts, it specifically refers to 'electric current'. It can also be used in the context of water flow or other fluid movements. The dictionary definition mentions that a protective cap ('kaitsekork') automatically disconnects an electrical circuit when the current is too strong."
