  "context": "The word 'käisime' is the 1st person plural past tense form of the Estonian verb 'käima', which means 'to go', 'to visit', or 'to travel'. It indicates that a group (including the speaker) went somewhere in the past. The '-me' ending clearly shows this as first person plural ('we') and the past tense is indicated by the vowel change from 'a' to 'i' plus the typical Estonian past tense marker '-s'."
