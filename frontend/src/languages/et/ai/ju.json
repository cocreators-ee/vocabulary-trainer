  "context": "The Estonian word 'ju' is a discourse particle that functions similarly to English particles like 'you know', 'actually', or 'really'. It's used for emphasis, confirmation, or to soften statements. In the examples provided: 'Tule ju siia!' uses 'ju' as an encouraging particle meaning 'come on here'; 'Kas sa tuled ju?' uses 'ju' to emphasize a question about coming; and 'Jah, see on ju ilus.' uses 'ju' for emphasis in stating something is beautiful. It doesn't have a direct one-to-one translation but serves conversational purposes."
