  "context": "The Estonian word 'ju' is a versatile adverb that serves multiple functions. It can emphasize what is said because it's considered already known or obvious, express probability/apparent likelihood, or function as a poetic/archaic equivalent of 'already'. In conversational contexts, it often seeks confirmation or implies shared understanding between speakers."
