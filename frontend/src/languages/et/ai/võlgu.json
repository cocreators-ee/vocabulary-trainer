  "context": "The Estonian word 'võlgu' is an adverbial form derived from the verb 'võluma' (to owe). It indicates that someone owes something, typically money or a favor. When used with a genitive case noun following it (e.g., 'võlgu raha'), it means 'owe [something]'. In Estonian grammar, this construction follows the pattern of owing TO someone or something."
