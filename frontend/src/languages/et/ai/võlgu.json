  "context": "The Estonian word 'võlgu' is an adverb that can mean several related things: 1) on credit or by taking a loan (as in buying something on credit), 2) unpaid, outstanding, or not yet settled (referring to money owed), and 3) undone, incomplete, or unfulfilled (referring to tasks or responsibilities). It often indicates that something is either borrowed money waiting to be repaid or an obligation that hasn't been completed. The word comes from 'võlg' meaning debt."
