  "context": "The word 'tüdrukuid' is the plural partitive form of 'tüdruk', which means 'girl'. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is used to indicate an unspecified or partial quantity. So 'tüdrukuid' can mean 'some girls' or refer to girls in a general sense when they are the object of an action rather than the subject."
