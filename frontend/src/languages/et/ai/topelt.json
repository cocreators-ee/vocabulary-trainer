  "context": "The Estonian word 'topelt' is an adverb that means 'double', 'twice', or 'duplicate'. It indicates something that has two parts, occurs twice, or is duplicated. For example, in 'topelts천idu pilet', it modifies the noun to indicate a double ticket (a ticket for two people or for round trip). When used with rooms like 'topeltoa', it describes a room with two beds. In mathematics or measurements, 'topeltm채rk' would refer to a double mark or symbol."
