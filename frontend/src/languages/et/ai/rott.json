  "context": "The Estonian word 'rott' primarily means 'rat', a larger rodent than mice with long tails. In colloquial usage, it can also refer to a cheapskate or moocher - someone who always asks for money and is stingy. The word has various compound forms like 'kodu rott' (house rat) and expressions such as 'vaene kui rott' (as poor as a rat). In idioms, it can describe behavior like running away from danger ('põgeneb nagu rott uppuvalt laevalt')."
