  "context": "Rott is the Estonian word for 'rat'. It refers to a small rodent animal that has a long tail and typically lives in urban areas or sewers. In Estonian, 'rott' can be used both literally to refer to the animal itself, and figuratively to describe someone as sneaky or unpleasant, similar to how English uses 'rat' metaphorically."
