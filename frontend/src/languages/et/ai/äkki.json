  "context": "The Estonian word 'äkki' is an adverb with two main meanings. First, it means 'suddenly', 'abruptly', or 'unexpectedly' when describing something that happens quickly and without warning. Second, it can express doubt or uncertainty by meaning 'maybe', 'possibly', or 'perhaps'. In the first sense, it's used to describe sudden events like appearances, actions, changes in weather, or unexpected occurrences. In the second sense, it introduces a suggestion of possibility when expressing suspicion, doubt, or hypothetical situations."
