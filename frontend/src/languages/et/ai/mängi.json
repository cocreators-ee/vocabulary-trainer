  "context": "The Estonian word 'mängi' is the imperative form of the verb 'mängima', which means 'to play'. It's used to tell someone to play, perform an activity, or engage in a game. In the given context from the dictionary entry, it appears in the phrase 'talita ausalt' alongside 'mängi', suggesting it might be contrasted with fair/ethical behavior, indicating that 'mängi' here could refer to competing or playing games rather than acting honestly."
