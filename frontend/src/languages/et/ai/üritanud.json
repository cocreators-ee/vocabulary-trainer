  "context": "The word 'üritanud' is the past tense (participle) form of the Estonian verb 'üritama', which means 'to try' or 'to attempt'. It indicates that an action was attempted in the past. The root word 'ür-' relates to effort and striving, while the '-it-' suffix forms the stem, and the '-anud' ending creates the past participle form."
