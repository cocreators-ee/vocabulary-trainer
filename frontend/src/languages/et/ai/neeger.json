  "context": "The word 'neeger' is an Estonian term originally meaning a person with dark skin, particularly those of African descent. It can be both neutral and pejorative depending on context, though in modern formal speech the preferred term is 'mustanahaline' (dark-skinned person). The word follows standard Estonian declension patterns and has various forms like neegri (genitive), neegrit (partitive), and neegrid (plural)."
