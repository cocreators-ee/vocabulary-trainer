  "context": "The word 'neeger' is a historical term for black people in Estonian. It was commonly used in the past but is now considered outdated and potentially offensive by many, similar to how 'negro' is viewed in English-speaking countries. The more neutral contemporary terms would be 'mustanahaline' (black-skinned person) or specific African ethnicity names when referring to people from particular regions of Africa."
