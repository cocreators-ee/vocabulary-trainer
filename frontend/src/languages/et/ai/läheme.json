  "context": "The word 'läheme' is the first-person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'minema', which means 'to go'. It translates to 'we go' or 'let's go' in English. This form indicates that a group including the speaker (first person) and others (plural) are currently going somewhere, or it can be used as an imperative suggesting that the group should go somewhere. In Estonian grammar, this combines the subject (me/we) with the verb stem läh- and the -eme ending for present tense first-person plural indicative."
