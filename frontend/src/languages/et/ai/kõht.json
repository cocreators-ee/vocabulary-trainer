  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõht' means belly or stomach and refers to the body part between the chest and pelvis. It can refer to both the physical belly/stomach area as well as the digestive organs inside. In plural form, it becomes 'kõhud'. The word is commonly used in expressions about hunger ('tühi kõht' - empty stomach), physical appearance ('paks kõht' - fat belly), and bodily functions (pain, rumbling)."
