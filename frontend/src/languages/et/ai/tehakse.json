  "context": "The Estonian word 'tehakse' is the 3rd person plural form of the verb 'tegema' (to do/make) in the passive voice. It's commonly used when talking about actions being performed by an unspecified or general group of people, similar to English expressions like 'one does', 'they make', or using the passive construction with 'is/are made'. The word indicates that some action is happening but the person/people doing it are either unknown or not important in the context."
