  "context": "In Estonian, 'tehakse' is the 3rd person singular/p plural form of the verb 'teha' (to make/do). It's used in a reflexive/passive sense where an action is being performed without specifying who is performing it. This construction is common in Estonian for general statements about what happens or what is done, similar to English passive constructions using 'one' or unspecified subjects."
