  "context": "The word 'kassi' is the genitive case form of the Estonian word 'kass', which means 'cat'. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case typically indicates possession or association. So 'kassi' would translate to 'of cat', 'for cat', or sometimes simply 'cat' depending on context. It can also refer to a kitten in some contexts."
