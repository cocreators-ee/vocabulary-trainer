  "context": "'Inimesi' is the partitive plural form of Estonian word 'inimene', which means 'person' or 'human being'. The partitive case in Estonian indicates an incomplete quantity, so when you say 'inimesi', you're referring to some people (not all people) or an unspecified number of people. This form is commonly used after numbers and with verbs that indicate having or seeing a certain amount of something."
