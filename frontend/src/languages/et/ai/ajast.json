  "context": "'Ajast' is the elative case singular form of 'aeg' (time). It means 'from time' and is commonly used in the phrase 'ajast ja arust' which means 'from ancient times', 'since time immemorial', or 'in olden days'. This expression refers to something that comes from very old or traditional times. The elative case indicates movement away from a location, so 'ajast' literally means 'from (out of) time'."
