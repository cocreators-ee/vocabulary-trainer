  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'tänulik' means grateful or thankful. It is formed from the word 'tänu' (thanks/gratitude) plus the suffix '-lik', which indicates a state or quality related to something. This adjective can be used to describe people who feel and express gratitude, as well as things that are pleasant, suitable, or satisfying in a broader sense. The word changes form based on case and number - for example, 'tänulikud' is the plural form meaning 'grateful (people)'. It's commonly used when someone wants to express appreciation for help, gifts, advice, or other favors."
