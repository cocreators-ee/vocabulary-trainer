  "context": "The Estonian word 'ta' is a third-person singular pronoun that means 'he', 'she', or 'it'. It's used to refer to a male person (he), female person (she), or object/animal/plant (it) in the singular form. This is similar to how English uses different pronouns for gender, but Estonian uses just one word regardless of gender when referring to people."
