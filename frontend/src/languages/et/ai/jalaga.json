  "context": "The Estonian phrase 'jalaga' (literally 'with a leg') is part of the idiom 'üks jalg hauas, teine haua äärel' which means having one foot in the grave and one on the edge of the grave. This expression is used to describe someone who is very old or near death, indicating they are close to dying. The phrase suggests that a person's life is almost over, similar to the English idiom 'with one foot in the grave'."
