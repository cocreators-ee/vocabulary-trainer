  "context": "The Estonian word 'udu' primarily means 'fog' or 'mist'. It refers to a collection of water droplets, ice crystals, or their mixture near the Earth's surface. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe confusion, obscurity, or vague memories ('mähkub uttu'). In astronomy, it can refer to nebulae ('udukogu'). The word has various compound forms specifying different types of fog such as 'hommiku udu' (morning mist), 'mere udu' (sea fog), etc."
