  "context": "The Estonian word 'põrgu' primarily means hell or the underworld in religious contexts - a place where sinners and pagans are sent after death. It can also metaphorically refer to any extremely difficult, terrible situation or place on earth that resembles hell, such as war zones, labor camps, or miserable living conditions. As an interjection, it's used for swearing and expressing strong emotions (similar to 'hell' in English expressions like 'What the hell!')."
