  "context": "The Estonian word 'ehtne' is an adjective that means genuine, authentic, real, or true. It can describe something that is not fake or counterfeit (like genuine pearls), something sincere and unfeigned (like genuine emotion), or something proper and typical (like a genuine sailor). The word declines with genitive ehtsa, partitive ehtsat, and plural form ehtsad."
