  "context": "The Estonian word 'kolm' is the cardinal number three. It's used to indicate quantity, order (when forming ordinal numbers), and time. As a numeral, it can appear in various grammatical forms including genitive 'kolme', partitive 'kolme', plural form 'kolmed', and has specific declension patterns for different cases. The word is fundamental in counting, telling time, expressing quantities ('three men'), mathematical concepts ('three times three equals nine'), and academic grades (where 3 represents a satisfactory grade)."
