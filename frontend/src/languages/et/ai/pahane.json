  "context": "The Estonian word 'pahane' is an adjective that describes someone who is angry, cross, or bad-tempered. It can refer to a temporary state of irritability or anger toward something or someone. The word can also be used more broadly to describe mean-spirited behavior or attitudes. In different contexts, it might express mild annoyance to significant anger. When used in plural form ('pahased'), it indicates that multiple people are angry with each other."
