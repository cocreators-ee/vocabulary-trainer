  "context": "The word 'nagunii' appears to be a variant or colloquial form of the Estonian phrase 'nagu nii', which means 'just like that' or 'in such a way'. It's used to express similarity, agreement, or to describe something as being in a particular state without further elaboration. The word is often used in conversational Estonian to emphasize that things are happening exactly as described or expected."
