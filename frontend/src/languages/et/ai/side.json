  "context": "In Estonian, 'side' has multiple meanings. It can refer to a physical bandage or binding used for tying things together (like grain stalks) or covering wounds. Medically, it's the material used for bandaging injuries. Figuratively, it means relationships, connections, or ties between people, groups, or countries. In modern technological contexts, 'side' can mean communication, signal, or even refer to post office services (colloquially). The word appears in many compound words like 'kaelaside' (neckband/scarf) and 'otseside' (direct communication/signal)."
