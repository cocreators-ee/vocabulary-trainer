  "context": "The word 'peabki' in Estonian is a combination of 'peab' (meaning 'must' or 'has to') and the particle 'ki' (which adds emphasis and means 'also', 'too', or 'as well'). It's used when someone has an obligation that also includes something additional. The word indicates necessity combined with additionality, often implying that something is required in addition to other requirements or expectations."
