  "context": "In Estonian, 'tuju' is a versatile noun that primarily refers to one's current emotional state or mood. It can describe a general feeling (good/bad mood), the disposition toward an activity (desire/willingness to do something), or even unpredictable circumstances related to nature or fate. The word appears in various compound forms like 'pulmatuju' (wedding atmosphere/mood) and reflects how Estonians conceptualize emotional states as temporary conditions that can change over time."
