  "context": "The word 'pimedaks' is the elative case form of the Estonian adjective 'pime', meaning 'dark' or 'blind'. It indicates movement into a state of darkness or becoming blind. The -ks ending in Estonian typically shows transition or change of state, making this an adessive-case form used to express 'into darkness' or 'becoming blind'. It's commonly used with verbs like tulema (to come), jooksma (to run), or tegema (to make/do) to describe entering a dark place or losing one's sight."
