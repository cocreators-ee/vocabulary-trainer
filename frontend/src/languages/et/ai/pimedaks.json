  "context": "The Estonian word 'pimedaks' is the transitive/intransitive illative case form of the adjective 'pime' (blind). It functions as a verb meaning 'to become blind' or 'to make someone/something blind.' In grammar, it's formed by adding '-ks' to the stem 'pime-', creating an action/state that results in blindness. This word appears to be derived from the root 'pime-' which relates to lack of sight."
