  "context": "The word 'silmade' is the Estonian genitive plural form of 'silma', which means 'eye'. In this case, it appears in the context of understanding or realization. The example sentence shows that when something suddenly becomes clear to someone, it's described as 'käe langeb silmalt', meaning a light falls on the eyes or insight dawns. This idiomatic expression is used when someone has an epiphany or sudden realization about something they were previously confused about."
