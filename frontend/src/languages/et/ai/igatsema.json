  "context": "The Estonian verb 'igatsema' is an imperfective verb that means to long for, yearn for, or miss someone or something. It expresses a deep emotional desire and longing, often used when missing people (family, friends) or places (home, familiar surroundings), or even past experiences. This verb takes the -ma ending which indicates it's in the infinitive form. The conjugation would change based on subject and tense, but the core meaning of emotional longing remains consistent."
