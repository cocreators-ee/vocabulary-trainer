  "context": "In Estonian, 'verd' is the partitive form of the word 'veri', which means 'blood'. The partitive case is used to indicate partialness or indefiniteness. In these examples, it shows possession ('on verd' - has blood), describes something that contains blood ('ninal verd' - blood in the nose), or indicates having gotten blood on oneself ('said verd peale' - got blood on themselves)."
