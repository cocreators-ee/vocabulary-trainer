  "context": "The Estonian word 'hale' is an adjective that describes a state of being healthy, well, or in good condition. It's commonly used to describe someone who has recovered from illness or is currently in good health. The word can be used for both people and animals when referring to their physical condition. For example, it might be said about someone after they've been sick but are now fully recovered. The opposite would be 'halb' (sick/ill)."
