  "context": "The Estonian word 'selliste' appears to be a form of the verb 'keerutama', which means to turn, rotate, spin or twirl something around an axis or pivot point. It can refer to physical rotation (like turning objects) as well as figurative rotation (like spinning in dancing). The word is likely part of the conjugation of this verb, possibly in a specific tense or mood. 'Keerutama' has multiple meanings including literally rotating objects, dancing by spinning around, winding materials into rolls, and metaphorically circling around topics in conversation."
