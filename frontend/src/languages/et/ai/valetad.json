  "context": "The word 'valetad' is the 2nd person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'valemama', meaning 'to lie' or 'to tell lies'. It's commonly used in questions about truthfulness, such as 'Kas sa valetad?' (Are you lying?). The word appears in dictionary definitions with example sentences showing its usage in contexts where someone is accused of not telling the truth. Estonian verbs have different forms depending on person and tense, so 'valetad' specifically refers to 'you lie/are lying' right now."
