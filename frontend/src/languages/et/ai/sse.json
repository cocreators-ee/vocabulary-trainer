  "context": "The Estonian word 'kere' refers to 1) the trunk/main body of a living being, specifically the central part without head and limbs; 2) the main or central part of vehicles, buildings, or objects (like ship hulls); and colloquially it can refer to the stomach/belly. It's used in both biological contexts ('kere jaguneb rindkereks ja kõhuks' - the body divides into chest and abdomen) and mechanical/structural contexts."
