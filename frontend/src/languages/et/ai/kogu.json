  "context": "The Estonian word 'kogu' is an indefinite pronoun that indicates something is being considered in its entirety or complete extent. It functions as a modifier for nouns, showing that the subject, place, phenomenon, group of people, etc., is being discussed as a whole unit rather than in parts. The word does not inflect and remains 'kogu' regardless of case or number."
