  "context": "The word 'valetasin' is the first person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'valema', which means 'to lie'. It specifically translates to 'I lied' in English. The '-sin' suffix indicates the first person singular (I) in past tense, while the root 'valeta-' comes from the verb meaning to tell falsehoods or not speak truthfully."
