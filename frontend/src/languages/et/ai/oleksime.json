  "context": "The Estonian word 'oleksime' is the conditional mood form of the verb 'olema' (to be) in first person plural ('me' - we). It expresses a hypothetical or unreal situation, similar to how English uses 'we would be' or 'we would have been'. This is often used in conditional sentences to talk about things that might happen or could have happened under certain conditions."
