  "context": "The word 'asjade' is an instrumental case form of the Estonian word 'asi' (thing/object). When combined with '-ga', it means 'with things'. This typically appears in contexts where someone is playing or engaging with objects, as shown in the dictionary example from L. Kibuvits where a child plays with cones and red sand."
