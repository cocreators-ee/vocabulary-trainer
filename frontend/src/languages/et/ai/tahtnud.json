  "context": "The word 'tahtnud' is the past active participle form of the Estonian verb 'tahtma', which means 'to want'. It functions similarly to English words like 'wanted' or 'desired'. In this form, it's used in perfect tenses and can also function as a passive voice construction. The '-nud' ending indicates that an action has been completed in the past."
