  "context": "The Estonian word 'vast' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings. It can indicate possibility or likelihood (similar to English 'maybe', 'possibly', 'perhaps'), often used when expressing uncertainty about an outcome. Additionally, it can mean 'recently', 'just now', or 'already', referring to something that happened very recently or occurred earlier than expected. The word appears in both contexts of probability and temporal reference."
