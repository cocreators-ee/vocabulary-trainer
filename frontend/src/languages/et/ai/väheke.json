  "context": "\"Väheke\" is an Estonian adverb that means \"a little bit\" or \"somewhat.\" It's formed from the word \"vähe\" (little/few) with the diminutive suffix \"-ke,\" which softens the meaning and adds a nuance of smallness or slightness. This adverb is used to indicate that something occurs in a small degree or quantity, often making statements less absolute or more gentle."
