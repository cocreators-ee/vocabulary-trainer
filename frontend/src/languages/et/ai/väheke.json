  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'väheke' expresses a small, somewhat indefinite quantity or degree. It is derived from the word 'vähe' (little/few) with the diminutive suffix '-ke', which softens and reduces the meaning. This makes it similar to English expressions like 'a little bit', 'slightly', or 'somewhat'. The word can modify both quantities and qualities, indicating a small change or amount in various contexts."
