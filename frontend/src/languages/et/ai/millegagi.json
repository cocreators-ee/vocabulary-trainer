  "context": "The Estonian word 'millegagi' is a combined form that means 'with something' or 'for some reason'. It's composed of 'mille-' (which indicates the case and number, essentially meaning 'of what/which') + '-gagi' (a suffix indicating accompaniment or instrumentality similar to English 'with'). This construction is often used when talking about having or using something, doing something for a particular reason, or indicating an unspecified cause or means. It's typically found in the adessive case and expresses association or accompaniment with some unspecified thing or reason."
