  "context": "The Estonian word 'seljas' is the partitive case form of 'selge' which means 'clear' or 'bright', but when used with clothing, it functions as a postposition meaning 'wearing' or 'in'. It indicates that someone has clothes on their body. This form is commonly used to describe what someone is wearing in Estonian."
