  "context": "The Estonian word 'seljas' is used to describe someone who has become arrogant or proud after gaining a higher position. It's an idiom that literally means something like 'nose in the air' but conveys the sense of becoming haughty, full of oneself, and looking down on others. The phrase often appears with 'nina püsti seljas' (nose upright in the back), creating a vivid image of someone walking around with their nose held high."
