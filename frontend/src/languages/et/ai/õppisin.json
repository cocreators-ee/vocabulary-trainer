  "context": "The word 'õppisin' is the first person singular past tense form of the verb 'õppima', which means 'to learn' or 'to study'. It specifically refers to completed learning actions in the past. The '-sin' suffix indicates that this is from the perspective of the speaker (I learned/studied). In Estonian, verbs have different conjugations for each person and tense, just like in many other languages."
