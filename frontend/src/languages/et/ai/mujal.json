  "context": "The Estonian word 'mujal' is an adverb that means 'elsewhere' or 'somewhere else'. It indicates movement to a different location than the current one. The word doesn't change form in different contexts as it's already in its basic adverbial form. It's commonly used when talking about going somewhere other than where someone currently is."
