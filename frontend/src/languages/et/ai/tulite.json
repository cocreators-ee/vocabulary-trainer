  "context": "Tulite is the second-person plural simple past tense form of the Estonian verb 'tulema', which means 'to come'. It specifically refers to multiple people in the past - 'you all came' or 'yous came' depending on regional dialect. The word appears in dictionary definitions related to travel and walking, but this is likely because it's used in context with descriptions of journeys rather than a direct meaning related to physical exertion."
