  "context": "The word 'tulite' appears to be a form of the Estonian verb 'tulla', which means 'to come'. The '-te' suffix typically indicates plural imperative or present tense in Estonian. So 'tulite' would mean 'you (plural) come' or 'you are coming'. It's used when addressing multiple people and telling them to come now, or describing that a group of people are currently arriving."
