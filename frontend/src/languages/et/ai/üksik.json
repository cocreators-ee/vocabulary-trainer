  "context": "The Estonian word 'üksik' is a versatile adjective with multiple meanings. It can describe someone who is alone or lonely (without companions), something that is the only one of its kind, separate or isolated from others, or in small numbers/few. The word derives from 'üks' meaning 'one' plus the suffix '-ik'. It's commonly used to describe solitary people (like a single child in a family), isolated objects (a single pine tree on the roadside), or when referring to few items (only a few lights were on)."
