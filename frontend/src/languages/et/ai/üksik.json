  "context": "The word 'üksik' is an Estonian adjective meaning single, individual, solitary, or alone. It describes something that exists separately from others or stands alone rather than being part of a group. In its basic form it modifies masculine nouns, but it changes form based on the gender and number of the noun it modifies - for feminine nouns it becomes 'üksik', for plural nouns it can take various forms depending on case."
