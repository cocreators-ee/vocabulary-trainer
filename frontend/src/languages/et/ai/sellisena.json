  "context": "The word 'sellisena' is an Estonian adverbial form that means 'such', 'in this way', or 'like this'. It's derived from the demonstrative pronoun 'selline' (such), with the '-na' suffix indicating an adverbial case. In the dictionary definition, it appears in the phrase '(sellisena kirjeldab Homeros jumalate naeru)' which means '(describes thus Homer the laughter of gods)', showing how this word can be used to describe the manner in which something is done or described."
