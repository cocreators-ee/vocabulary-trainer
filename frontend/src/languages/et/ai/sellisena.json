  "context": "The word 'sellisena' in Estonian means 'like that', 'in such a way', or 'as is'. It's the adessive case form of 'selline' (such/that), used to indicate the manner, state, or condition something exists in. The '-na' ending indicates the adessive case, which often corresponds to English prepositions like 'in', 'at', or 'with'. When describing how something is or remains, this form would be used."
