  "context": "The Estonian word 'sügavale' is an adverb that means deeply or to a great depth. It can be used in several contexts: 1) Physically going downward from a surface (like wells, stairs, seeds being planted too deep); 2) Penetrating far into something (like enemies penetrating into territory, ideas spreading among people); 3) Metaphorically referring to moral or emotional depths (someone falling deeply into bad habits). The word indicates movement or state of being at a significant depth in both literal and figurative senses."
