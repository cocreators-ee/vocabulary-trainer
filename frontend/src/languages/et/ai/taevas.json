  "context": "The Estonian word 'taevas' can refer to both the physical sky (the expanse above the Earth) and heaven as a spiritual or religious concept. It's similar to how English uses 'sky' for the atmospheric space and 'heaven' for the divine realm, though 'taevas' can cover both meanings depending on context."
