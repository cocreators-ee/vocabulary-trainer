  "context": "The word 'jätsin' is the first-person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'jätma', which means to leave, put aside, abandon, or neglect. It indicates that someone did something in the past and then left it as a result. In the example sentence 'jätsin külla minemata,' it specifically means I didn't go visit (someone) - literally 'left going unvisited'. The verb can be used with various objects to indicate leaving things undone, abandoned, or put aside."
