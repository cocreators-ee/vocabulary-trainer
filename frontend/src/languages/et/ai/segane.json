  "context": "The Estonian word 'segane' is an adjective that describes something as being confused, messy, unclear, or turbid. It can be used to describe mental confusion (a confused state of mind), physical messiness (something disorderly or untidy), lack of clarity (unclear situation), or physical opacity (turbid water). The word derives from the verb 'sega' meaning 'mixed', and '-ne' is a common adjectival suffix in Estonian."
