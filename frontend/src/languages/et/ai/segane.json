  "context": "The Estonian word 'segane' is an adjective with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean unclear or confused when referring to information (like unclear instructions), muddled or turbid when describing visual appearance or liquids, and deranged or crazy when used for people's mental state. The comparative form is 'segasem' and it changes based on case - genitive 'segase', partitive 'segast'. It comes from the root verb 'segama' (to mix) plus the suffix '-ne'. Examples show its use in describing unclear writing, someone becoming more confused over time, and a person being overwhelmed with emotion."
