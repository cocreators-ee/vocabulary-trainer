  "context": "The word 'kaugusel' is the inessive case (inessiiv) form of the Estonian noun 'kaugus', which means 'distance'. In this case, it indicates location at or within a certain distance. The ending '-el' marks the inessive case used to express being inside something or in a location. It's commonly used with prepositions or spatial contexts to indicate where something is located in relation to a point of reference."
