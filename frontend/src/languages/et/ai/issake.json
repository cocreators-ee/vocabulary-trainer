  "context": "The word 'issake' is an affectionate diminutive form of the Estonian word 'isa' (father), similar to how English speakers might say 'daddy' instead of 'father'. It's a term used primarily by children when speaking to or about their fathers, conveying warmth and familiarity. The '-ke' suffix in Estonian creates diminutives and affectionate forms of words."
