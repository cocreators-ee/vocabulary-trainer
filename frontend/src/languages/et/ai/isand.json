  "context": "The Estonian word 'isand' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can refer to a lord or master (in feudal contexts), an upper-class gentleman, a husband (archaically), or simply a respected man/sir. The word shows different cases in grammar - the genitive form is 'isanda', partitive is 'isandat'. Historically it comes from Proto-Finnic *icäntä and carries connotations of authority, ownership, and social status."
