  "context": "The word 'plaane' is the partitive form of 'plaan' in Estonian. The partitive case typically indicates an incomplete action or object, so this would mean 'some plans' or 'planets' (in the sense of having plans but not necessarily completing all of them). It's used when talking about existing plans that exist in some quantity but haven't been completed yet."
