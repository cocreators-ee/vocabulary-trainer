  "context": "The word 'plaane' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'plaan'. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is used to indicate partiality or indefiniteness. So 'plaane' refers to portions or parts of plans, rather than complete plans themselves. This grammatical form is commonly used when talking about multiple incomplete plans or parts of planning work."
