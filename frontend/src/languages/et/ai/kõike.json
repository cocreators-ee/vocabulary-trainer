  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõike' is the partitive case form of 'kõik', meaning 'everything' or 'all'. It's used to indicate an unspecified amount or entirety of something. The partitive case in Estonian often indicates incomplete action, but with words like 'kõik', it shows that we're talking about all of something as a general concept rather than a specific quantity."
