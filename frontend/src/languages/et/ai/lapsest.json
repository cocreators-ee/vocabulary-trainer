  "context": "The Estonian word 'lapsest' is an elative case form of the noun 'laps', which means 'child'. The elative case in Estonian indicates movement away from or separation from a location, and can also be used to indicate source or origin. So 'lapsest' typically translates to English as 'from the child' but depending on context can also mean 'about the child' or 'starting from the child'. It's formed by adding the elative suffix '-st' to the root word 'laps'."
