  "context": "The word 'leppida' in Estonian is used to express the ability or capacity to accept something emotionally, particularly difficult situations. It relates to being able to cope with or endure emotional challenges. The dictionary example shows its usage in contexts where someone is hurt by rejection - they either can't handle it ('ei mahtunud hinge') or are able to endure it ('hinge mahtus')."
