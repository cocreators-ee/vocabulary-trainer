  "context": "The Estonian word 'kohting' refers to an arranged or pre-arranged meeting, often implying a social get-together between people who have agreed to meet. It's commonly used for dates or planned encounters rather than chance meetings. The word comes from the verb 'kohtuma' (to meet) and carries a sense of intentional scheduling and anticipation. In Estonian culture, it might be used when friends arrange to meet up, but particularly has connotations of romantic arrangements or formalized social appointments."
