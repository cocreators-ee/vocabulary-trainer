  "context": "The Estonian word 'vist' is an adverb used to express probability, uncertainty, or supposition. It indicates that something is likely but not certain - similar to English words like 'probably', 'possibly', or 'perhaps'. The examples show how it's commonly used with verbs and in everyday expressions where there's some doubt or assumption about a situation."
