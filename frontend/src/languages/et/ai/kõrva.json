  "context": "The word 'kõrva' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'kõrv', which means 'ear'. The genitive case in Estonian typically indicates possession or relationship, and can also be used with certain prepositions or to indicate a part of something. In English translations, this would often correspond to constructions like 'of the ear' or possessive forms."
