  "context": "The word 'lõksus' appears to be a form of the Estonian adverb 'eks', which is used in various contexts including expressing agreement, confirmation, emphasis, and sometimes even mild surprise or acknowledgment. It's commonly used as an introductory particle or response word that indicates affirmation or acceptance. The examples show it being used with slightly different conjugations but essentially serving the same function of positive affirmation."
