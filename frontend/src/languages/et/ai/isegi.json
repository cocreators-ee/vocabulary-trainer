  "context": "The Estonian word 'isegi' is an adverb that means 'even', used to emphasize something beyond what was expected or mentioned. It's formed from 'ise' (oneself) and '-gi' (also/too particle). The word can be placed in different positions within a sentence but typically emphasizes the following element, highlighting that it applies despite contrary expectations or in addition to other things."
