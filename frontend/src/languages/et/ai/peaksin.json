  "context": "The word 'peaksin' is the first person singular conditional form of the verb 'pidama' (to have to, should). It indicates obligation or necessity in a hypothetical situation. The dictionary definition shows that 'peaksin olema arulage, kui seda teeksin' means 'I would be foolish if I did that,' indicating that the speaker recognizes an action as unwise and therefore shouldn't do it."
