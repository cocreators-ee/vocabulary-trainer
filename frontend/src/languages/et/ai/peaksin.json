  "context": "'Peaksin' is the conditional form of the verb 'pidama' (to have/should) in Estonian, specifically the first person singular present conditional. It expresses obligation, necessity or what one should do. The word combines the stem 'pea-' with the conditional suffix '-ksin' and indicates a speaker's sense of duty or recommendation about an action that is advisable but not absolutely required."
