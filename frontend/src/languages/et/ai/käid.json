  "context": "The Estonian word 'käid' (present form of the verb) is related to the more common form 'sörkima'. It means to move with a light, quick gait - like jogging or trotting. It's often used for animals following their owners or people moving at a steady but not running pace. The word can describe both human movement (like health jogging) and animal locomotion (like horses trotting or dogs walking behind their masters)."
