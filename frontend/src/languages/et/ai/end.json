  "context": "The word 'end' in Estonian is the partitive singular form of the pronoun 'ise', meaning 'oneself'. It's used to refer back to the subject of the sentence, often emphasizing that someone did something independently or for themselves. In different contexts, it can appear as 'endas' (in oneself), 'endale' (to oneself), and other case forms depending on grammatical requirements."
