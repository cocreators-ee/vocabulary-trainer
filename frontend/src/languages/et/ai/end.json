  "context": "The Estonian word 'end' is a reflexive pronoun that means 'oneself'. It's used when the subject and object of a verb are the same person, similar to English reflexive pronouns like myself, yourself, himself, etc. In Estonian grammar, it declines according to case (nominative end, genitive enda, partitive endat), but the basic form 'end' is commonly used in everyday language."
