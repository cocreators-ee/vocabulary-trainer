  "context": "The word 'magad' is the plural form of the Estonian verb 'magama', which means 'to sleep'. In the context provided, it appears in the poetic phrase 'Nüüd magad siin / kabelis mulla all' meaning 'Now you lie here/sleep in the chapel underground/buried under earth.' This suggests a metaphorical use where death is described as sleeping or resting under the ground. The word can refer to both literal sleep and more figurative meanings of being at rest or dormant."
