  "context": "The Estonian word 'ime' primarily means miracle or wonder, referring to something supernatural, inexplicable, or very surprising. It can be used both literally for miraculous events and figuratively as an emphatic expression of surprise or emphasis in exclamations. The word appears in compound forms likelooduseime (nature's miracle) or teknika ime (technological marvel). In informal speech, it serves as a strengthening particle in expressions of astonishment or displeasure."
