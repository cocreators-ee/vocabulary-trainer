  "context": "The word 'jaga' in Estonian is a verb that means to divide, share, or distribute. It appears in the dictionary definition as part of an idiomatic expression where it's used with plural nouns like 'aju(d)' (brains) to indicate that someone doesn't share their thoughts or ideas with others. The examples show how it can be used in context - particularly in expressions related to sharing one's thoughts or mental abilities, though the word itself has broader meanings of dividing or distributing things among people."
