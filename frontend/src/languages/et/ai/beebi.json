  "context": "The Estonian word 'beebi' is a loanword from English, meaning 'baby' or 'infant'. It's commonly used to refer to young children, especially newborns and infants. The word follows the same grammatical patterns as other Estonian nouns, so it can take case endings like '-ga' (with), '-le' (to), etc."
