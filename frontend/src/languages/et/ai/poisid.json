  "context": "The word 'poisid' is the plural form of 'poiss' in Estonian, meaning 'boy'. It refers to multiple boys or young males. In Estonian grammar, this follows the regular declension pattern where masculine nouns ending in -s in singular become -d in plural when referring to subjects/nominative case."
