  "context": "The Estonian word 'mul' is the first-person singular possessive pronoun, which means 'my' or indicates possession in the nominative case. It's commonly used with verbs to express what someone has or experiences (similar to 'I have' in English). In sentence structure, it typically appears at the beginning of clauses and is followed by a verb that expresses possession, experience, or state."
