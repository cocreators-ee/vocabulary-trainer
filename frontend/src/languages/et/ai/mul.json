  "context": "The Estonian word 'mul' is the adessive singular form of the pronoun 'ma' (I/me). It indicates location or association with a place - essentially meaning 'at me,' 'on me,' or 'by me.' In English translations, it often functions as 'for me' or shows possession/association. For example, in 'Mul on hea tuju' it means 'I have a good mood' (literally 'At me is good mood'). The word is used unstressed in sentences; when stressed, the longer form 'minul' would be used instead."
