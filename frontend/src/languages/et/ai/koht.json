  "context": "The Estonian word 'koht' is a versatile noun with multiple meanings. It can refer to a physical place or location (such as beautiful natural places, the snowiest spot in Estonia), a position or seat (like a good spot for an inn or seating arrangements), and by extension, it can mean a job position or status in society. The word changes form based on case - 'koha' is the genitive form, 'kohta' is partitive, etc. It's one of those fundamental Estonian words that appears in many contexts and compounds."
