  "context": "The word 'millist' is the partitive singular form of interrogative pronoun 'milline', meaning 'which one' or 'what kind'. It's used when asking about a specific instance among many possibilities, and in Estonian it appears in the partitive case to indicate selection from multiple options. The dictionary shows it relates to rights/privileges ('eesõigused'), but this appears to be separate examples using that word rather than defining 'millist' itself."
