  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'tõepoolest' is used to confirm or emphasize that something is true. It can be translated as 'indeed', 'really', 'truly', 'actually', or 'in fact'. The word combines 'tõe' (truth) with the instrumental case suffix 'poolest' (by means of), literally meaning 'by truth' or 'according to truth'. It's commonly used in everyday conversation to affirm statements, express agreement, or confirm that something is as stated."
