  "context": "The Estonian word 'õhus' means 'in the air' or 'in the atmosphere'. It is the inessive case (locative case indicating location within something) of the noun 'õhk', which means 'air'. The '-s' ending indicates that it's referring to being inside or within air. This form would be used when talking about something existing within the air, such as pollutants being in the air, or air quality conditions."
