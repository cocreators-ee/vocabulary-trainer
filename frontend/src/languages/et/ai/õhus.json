  "context": "The Estonian word 'õhus' is an adessive case form of 'õhu' (air), meaning 'in the air'. It's used metaphorically to describe situations that are uncertain, unresolved, or pending. This expression is commonly used when referring to plans, decisions, or events whose outcome is not yet determined - similar to the English idiom 'up in the air'."
