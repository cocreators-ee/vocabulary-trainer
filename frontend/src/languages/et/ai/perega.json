  "context": "The word 'perega' is the elative case form of the adjective 'perekas', which means having many members or being numerous/large in terms of family size. In Estonian, the elative case (-st) indicates movement out of something, but here it appears to be used as part of a compound expression meaning 'with a large family' or 'numerous'. The word is related to 'pere' (family) and describes things that have many members or are populous."
