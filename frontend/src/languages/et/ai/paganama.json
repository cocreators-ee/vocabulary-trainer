  "context": "The Estonian word 'paganama' is an adverb used as an intensifier to express strong emotions, both negative (like frustration or emphasis) and positive (like admiration). It can function similarly to English swear words like 'damn' or 'hell', but also as a general intensifier meaning 'very,' 'extremely,' or 'awfully.' In its first usage pattern, it expresses derogatory or sometimes admiring/enthusiastic attitude. In its second usage pattern, it modifies adjectives and other adverbs to mean 'very' or 'extremely.' The word is versatile and appears in various contexts including everyday expressions and literary texts."
