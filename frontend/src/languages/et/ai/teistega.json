  "context": "The word 'teistega' in Estonian is part of the compound word 'antagonistideks' (in instrumental case) and means 'with others' or 'among other things'. It's used here to describe relationships where entities have opposing effects, such as in biology where certain microbes are antagonists to pathogenic ones. The root form would be 'teine' meaning 'other', with '-ga' suffix indicating accompaniment or instrumentality."
