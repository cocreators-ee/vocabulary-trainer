  "context": "The word 'ainult' is an Estonian adverb that means 'only' or 'just'. It's used to indicate exclusivity or limitation, emphasizing that something is restricted to a specific person, thing, quantity, or condition. In the first sentence, it specifies when someone will come (only at 1 o'clock). In the second sentence, it restricts the height of the house (only three stories). In the third sentence, it limits who can do something (only children can do this)."
