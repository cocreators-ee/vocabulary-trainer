  "context": "The Estonian word 'ainult' is a versatile adverb that functions as an intensifier, limiter, or clarifier in sentences. It can indicate something is less than needed or expected (not more than), exclude other possibilities (only), emphasize what is being said (just/merely), or limit the scope of a preceding statement. The word commonly appears at various positions within sentences and can modify both nouns and verbs."
