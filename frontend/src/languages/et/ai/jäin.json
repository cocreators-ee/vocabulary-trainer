  "context": "The word 'jäin' is the first-person singular past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'jääma', which means to remain, stay, or be left. It indicates that someone remained in a certain place or state in the past. For example, if someone says 'Ma jäin kodu,' it means 'I stayed at home.' The word implies staying somewhere for an extended period rather than just visiting temporarily."
