  "context": "The word 'tappis' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'tapma', which means to kill or murder. In this case, it appears in a narrative context describing someone taking another person's life. The dictionary definition suggests this is specifically used for killing people rather than animals (which would be 'tappa')."
