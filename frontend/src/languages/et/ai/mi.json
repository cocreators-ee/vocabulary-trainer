  "context": "The word 'mi' in Estonian appears to be a misspelling or variation of the imperative form 'mine', which means 'go' or 'leave'. In Estonian, the correct imperative form is usually 'mine' (singular) or 'minemage' (plural). The word might also be confused with 'mida' meaning 'what', but given the context, it's most likely referring to the command form. Estonian is a Finno-Ugric language and has different grammatical structures than Indo-European languages."
