  "context": "In Estonian music theory, 'mi' refers to the third note (E) in the diatonic major scale. It is a solfège syllable used in the movable do system where each note of the scale is assigned a syllable name. The word appears to be derived from the European fixed-do system where 'mi' corresponds to the note E."
