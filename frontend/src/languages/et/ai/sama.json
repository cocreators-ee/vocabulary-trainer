  "context": "The Estonian word 'sama' primarily means 'same' and functions as both an adjective and adverb. It's used to indicate equality or similarity between things or people. As an adjective, it can decline in various cases (genitive, partitive, etc.), and as an adverb, it modifies verbs or adjectives to show that something is equally true or similar."
