  "context": "The Estonian word 'sama' is an adjective that means 'same', 'equal', or 'identical'. It can be used to indicate that two things are equal or identical in some way. In different contexts, it might refer to the same person, same opinion, same object, etc. The word doesn't change form based on gender but may need to be declined according to case when used in sentences with different grammatical structures."
