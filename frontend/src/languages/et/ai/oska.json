  "context": "The Estonian verb 'oska' means 'to know how to do something' or 'to be able to do something'. It indicates having a skill or the ability to perform an action. In the dictionary example provided, it appears in the negative form 'ei oska' meaning 'cannot choose', showing that someone is unable to make a decision between two equal options (like Buridan's ass being stuck between two equally appealing choices). The verb comes from the root 'os-' which relates to capability and skill."
