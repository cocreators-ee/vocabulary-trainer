  "context": "In Estonian, 'lüüa' is a versatile verb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean to physically hit or strike something/someone (like hitting a person), to throw something forcefully (like throwing a stone), or to break something. The form changes in different tenses and aspects - for example 'lööb' is third-person singular present tense, 'lõi' is past tense, and 'löövad' is plural present tense. It's one of the most common action verbs in Estonian with both physical motion and destruction meanings."
