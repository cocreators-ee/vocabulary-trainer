  "context": "The word 'tõstke' is the imperative plural form of the Estonian verb 'tõsta', meaning 'to lift' or 'to raise'. It's used when addressing multiple people and commanding them to lift, raise, or present something. This could be literally lifting an object off the ground, or metaphorically raising a topic for discussion, presenting evidence, etc. The dictionary shows related phrase constructions like 'tõstkeendaleette' which means 'raise/lift up for yourselves'."
