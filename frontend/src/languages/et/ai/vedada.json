  "context": "The Estonian verb 'vedada' means to pull, drag, or haul something. It's used when applying force to move an object along a surface by grasping it and pulling it in the direction of movement. The word can be used for both physical objects (like furniture) and metaphorical situations. In different contexts, it might imply gentle pulling (like leading someone by the hand) or more forceful dragging."
