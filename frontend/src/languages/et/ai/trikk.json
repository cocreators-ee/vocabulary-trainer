  "context": "In Estonian, 'trikk' is a noun that refers to a trick, ruse, scheme, or artifice. It can be used to describe clever methods used to achieve something or deceive someone in some way. The word appears to be of foreign origin (likely from English 'trick') and is commonly used in modern Estonian. Examples show it being used in everyday contexts like TV shows and personal strategies."
