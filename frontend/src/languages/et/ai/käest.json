  "context": "The Estonian word 'käest' is an elative case form of the word 'käs' (hand). It means 'from a hand' or indicates that something was taken, given, or obtained by hand. It can also be used to indicate receiving help from someone, similar to English expressions like 'by hand' or 'from someone's hand'. The elative case in Estonian typically shows movement away from or out of something."
