  "context": "The Estonian word 'vihkad' is a verb that means to howl, rage, or storm. It's used to describe strong wind making loud noises as it blows forcefully through something. The word appears to be in the third person singular form (he/she/it howls/rages/storms) of the verb. In the example sentence from G. Suits' poem, it describes a wild autumn wind that is raging or howling violently."
