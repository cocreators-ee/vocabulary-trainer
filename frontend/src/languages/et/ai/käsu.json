  "context": "The word 'käsu' in Estonian is the translative form of 'käsk' (command/order), meaning 'by means of a command' or 'in the manner of an order'. It's derived from the verb dekreteerima (to decree). In context, it indicates that something was done through or by means of a formal command or decree. The word carries connotations of officialdom and bureaucracy, as seen in the dictionary example mentioning bürokraatide (bureaucrats') tendency to issue such commands."
