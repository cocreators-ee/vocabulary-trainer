  "context": "The word 'selja' is the genitive singular form of 'selg', meaning 'back'. It can be used to indicate position behind something or someone, as in 'elad nagu vanajumala selja taga' (you live like an old god behind/back). The phrase 'selja taga' specifically means 'behind' or 'at the back of'. In other contexts, it can refer to the背部 (back part) when used in different constructions."
