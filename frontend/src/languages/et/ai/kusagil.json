  "context": "The word 'kusagil' is an Estonian adverb that means 'somewhere'. It indicates an unspecified or unknown location, similar to the English word 'somewhere'. It can be used both affirmatively (to indicate existence in a place) and negatively (to indicate absence from a place). The word is formed from 'kuskil' with a slight variation in spelling but carries the same meaning of indicating a general, unspecified location."
