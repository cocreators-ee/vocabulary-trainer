  "context": "In Estonian, 'poega' is the partitive case form of the word 'poeg', which means 'son'. The partitive case in Estonian is used to indicate that something is being acted upon or affected by an action. So when you have 'poega', it typically follows a verb and indicates that someone's son is being referred to, as in 'I am looking for my son' (Ma otsin oma poega). It can also mean 'of a son' when used possessively."
