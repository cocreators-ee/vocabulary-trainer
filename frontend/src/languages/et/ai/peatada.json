  "context": "The word 'peatamatu' is an adjective in Estonian that describes something or someone that cannot be stopped or halted. It conveys the idea of being unstoppable, irrepressible, or having no brakes. The root word 'peata-' relates to stopping (from 'peata' meaning 'to stop'), and the suffix '-matu' indicates inability or impossibility. This is used for describing natural phenomena like endless clouds, or human characteristics like uncontrollable anger."
