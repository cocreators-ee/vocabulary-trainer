  "context": "The Estonian word 'eest' is a versatile word with multiple meanings depending on context. As an adverb, it can mean 'from the front' (indicating position), 'off/away' (removing something), or 'ago' (referring to time in the past). As a postposition, it governs the genitive case and means 'from the front of', 'from', 'for' (indicating purpose or support), or 'in exchange for'. It's commonly used in various idiomatic expressions. The meaning is determined by grammatical context - whether it's modifying a verb directly or following a noun with genitive case."
