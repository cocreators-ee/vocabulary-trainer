  "context": "The word 'haigeks' is the illative case form of the Estonian adjective 'haige', meaning 'ill' or 'sick'. In Estonian grammar, the illative case indicates motion into something. So 'haigeks' can be translated as 'into illness' or more naturally in English as simply becoming sick/ill/unwell. It's commonly used when someone becomes ill or catches a sickness."
