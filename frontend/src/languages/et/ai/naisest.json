  "context": "The word 'naisest' in Estonian is a compound word formed by combining 'naise-' (feminine, female) and the '-st' suffix indicating origin or source. It literally means 'from woman' or 'female-derived'. In the context given from M.Mutt's work, it refers to love that originates from or is characteristic of femininity - a specific type of affection that has feminine qualities or comes from a female perspective. The word appears to be modifying 'armastus' (love), suggesting 'naisearm' which means female-derived love or woman-based affection."
