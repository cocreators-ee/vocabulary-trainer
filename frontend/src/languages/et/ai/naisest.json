  "context": "The word 'naisest' is the elative case form of the Estonian noun 'naine', which means 'woman'. In Estonian, the elative case (-st ending) indicates movement away from or out of something, but it can also be used in contexts where English would use 'about' or 'concerning' when referring to a person. The word specifically refers to a woman (in singular form)."
