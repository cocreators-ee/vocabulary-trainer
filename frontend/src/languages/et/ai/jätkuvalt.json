  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'jätkuvalt' means continuously, constantly, or persistently. It indicates that something continues without interruption or persists over time. The word comes from the root 'jätkama' (to continue) and the suffix '-valt' which forms adverbs indicating manner or continuity. In the dictionary examples provided, it shows usage like 'Jätkuvalt aktuaalne probleem' (continuously relevant problem) and 'Huvi rahvakunsti vastu on jätkuvalt kasvanud' (Interest in folk art has continuously grown)."
