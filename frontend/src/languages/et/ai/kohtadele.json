  "context": "The word 'kohtadele' is the allative case form of 'kohtad', meaning 'to places'. It's used in the context of describing large numbers of people rushing or pushing towards limited places or opportunities. In Estonian grammar, the allative case (-le) indicates movement to or towards a location. When combined with 'tung' (rush/crush), it forms expressions like 'suur tung kohtadele' meaning 'a big rush to places', commonly used for situations where there's high demand for limited positions such as university spots, concert tickets, etc."
