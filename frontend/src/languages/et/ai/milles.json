  "context": "The Estonian word 'milles' is an interrogative pronoun in the inessive case (local case indicating location within something). It asks about location or position within a space or context, functioning similarly to English phrases like 'in what', 'where', or 'in which'. The word is formed by adding the inessive case ending '-s' to the interrogative pronoun 'milline' (what kind of/which), but when used for location questions it takes on the meaning of asking about place or context."
