  "context": "The word 'räägite' is the formal second person plural form of the verb 'rääkima' in Estonian, meaning 'to speak'. It's used when addressing multiple people formally or respectfully. The '-te' suffix indicates the polite/formal address to a group. In English, this would be equivalent to 'you all speak' or simply 'you speak' in formal contexts."
