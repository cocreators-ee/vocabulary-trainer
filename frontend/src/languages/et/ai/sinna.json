  "context": "The Estonian word 'sinna' is an adverb indicating motion toward a distant or farther place from the speaker. It's the sublative form of 'see' meaning 'it', similar to Finnish 'sinne'. The word points to a destination away from the speaker, in contrast to 'siia' which means 'here/toward here'. Sinna can indicate physical movement (to go there), reference to previously mentioned places, or even abstract destinations. It's commonly used with verbs of motion like 'mine' (to go) and appears in expressions indicating direction or destination."
