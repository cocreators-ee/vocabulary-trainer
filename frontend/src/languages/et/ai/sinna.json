  "context": "The Estonian word 'sinna' is an adverb that indicates movement toward or direction to a specific location, typically one that is distant from both the speaker and listener. It functions similarly to English 'there' when indicating direction rather than position, but more specifically means 'to that place' or 'thither'. This directional contrast with 'siia' (here/to here) shows its role in spatial reference. It's commonly used when referring to places previously mentioned or known from context."
