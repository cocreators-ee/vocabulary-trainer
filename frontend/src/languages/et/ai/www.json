  "context": "In Estonian, 'www' is commonly used as an abbreviation for the World Wide Web. It's typically placed at the beginning of website addresses to indicate that they are web pages on the internet. This usage follows international conventions where www serves as a subdomain prefix for websites. The Estonian language adopts this technical term directly from English without modification, maintaining its standard form across all contexts."
