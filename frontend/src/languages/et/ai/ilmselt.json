  "context": "The Estonian word 'ilmselt' is an adverb that means 'probably', 'most likely', or 'apparently'. It indicates that something is evident or appears to be true based on available evidence, though not with absolute certainty. The dictionary definitions show it can mean 'silmanähtavalt, selgesti, kindlalt' (visibly, clearly, certainly) as well as 'nagu näha, küllap' (as seen, likely). It's used to express a reasonable inference or assumption when something appears to be the case."
