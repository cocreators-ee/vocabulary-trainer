  "context": "Härra is the Estonian word for 'sir' or 'mister', used as a title when addressing men. It can also refer to a gentleman, particularly an upper-class or wealthy man. The word has multiple applications: it serves as a formal form of address similar to English 'Mr.', can describe refined male behavior and appearance, historically referred to masters or lords (like landowners), and is commonly used in combinations with other words (like Härra President - Mr. President). It's the counterpart to 'daam' (lady) and shows respect when addressing men."
