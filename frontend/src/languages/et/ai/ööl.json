  "context": "The word 'ööl' is the Estonian adessive case form of 'öö', meaning 'night'. It indicates location or time, specifically meaning 'at night' or 'during the night'. This form is used when something happens at a particular time during the night, similar to how English uses prepositions like 'at' with 'night'."
