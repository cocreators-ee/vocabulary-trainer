  "context": "The word 'rääkimata' is an Estonian adverbial form that means 'without speaking' or 'not to mention'. It's formed from the verb 'rääkima' (to speak) with the negative suffix '-ta', indicating the absence of action. This construction is used to emphasize something even more significant by suggesting it goes without saying, similar to English expressions like 'let alone'."
