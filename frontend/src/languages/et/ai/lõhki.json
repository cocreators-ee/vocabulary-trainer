  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõhki' is an adverb that means something is split, broken, or divided into pieces. It can refer to physical objects being cut or broken (like wood, clothes, or containers), and metaphorically it can describe situations where things are ruined beyond repair or relationships have completely broken down. The word indicates a state of being divided or destroyed, often with the implication that the original integrity is lost."
