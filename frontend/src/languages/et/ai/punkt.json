  "context": "The Estonian word 'punkt' has multiple meanings depending on context. As an adverb, it means 'exactly' or 'precisely.' As a noun, it can mean a dot/point, article of clothing, item, or period/full stop in writing. It appears to function similarly to the English use of 'sharp' with time expressions (e.g., 'seven sharp')."
