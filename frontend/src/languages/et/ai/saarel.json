  "context": "The word 'saarel' appears to be part of a larger phrase referring to the Ainu people, indigenous inhabitants of Japanese islands, particularly Hokkaido. It seems to be an incomplete or truncated entry in the dictionary that shows 'ainud pl Jaapani saarte põlisasukad, tänapäeval peam. Hokkaido saarel' which translates to 'Ainu pl indigenous inhabitants of Japanese islands, nowadays mainly Hokkaido'. The word 'saarel' on its own is not clearly defined but appears in this context about the Ainu people."
