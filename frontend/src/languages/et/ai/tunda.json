  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunda' is a versatile verb that primarily means 'to feel' or 'to seem/appear'. It can be used to express personal sensations (like feeling something) as well as subjective perceptions about situations (how things seem to someone). In its reflexive form 'tunduda', it specifically expresses how something appears to someone. The conjugation varies depending on the subject and tense, but it maintains this core meaning of sensory perception or appearance."
