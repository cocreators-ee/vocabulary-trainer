  "context": "The word 'elajas' is an Estonian noun meaning animal or creature. It can refer to any living being, particularly non-human animals. In Estonian grammar, this form appears to be in the partitive case ('-s' ending), which is used when indicating existence or presence of something, or when talking about some animals without specifying a particular one."
