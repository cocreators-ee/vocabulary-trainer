  "context": "In Estonian, 'elajas' is a noun that refers to an animal or beast. It can be used literally to refer to livestock or cattle (like cows), but it's also commonly used as an insult or swear word to describe someone negatively. The term carries a strong negative emotional connotation when used in this way, similar to calling someone a 'beast' or 'animal' in English. Examples show it being used to describe people who behave like animals - crawling on all fours, eating greedily, or making animal-like sounds."
