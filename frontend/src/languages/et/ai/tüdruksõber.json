  "context": "The word 'tüdruksõber' is a compound Estonian noun meaning 'girlfriend'. It's formed from 'tütar' (girl) + 'sõber' (friend), literally translating to 'girl-friend'. This term typically refers to a romantic partner who is female, though it can sometimes be used more broadly for close female friends. The word follows Estonian compound noun formation rules where the parts are joined together without spaces."
