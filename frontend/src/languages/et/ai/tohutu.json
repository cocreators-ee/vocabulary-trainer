  "context": "The word 'tohutu' is an Estonian adjective that means enormous, huge, immense or tremendous. It's used to describe something of exceptional size, scale or magnitude. The word can be used for both positive and negative contexts - it can describe something impressively large in a good way (like success or beauty) or something overwhelming in a bad way. In Estonian grammar, 'tohutu' is typically an attributive adjective that would modify nouns, though it could potentially appear in other forms like the adverbial form 'tohutult' meaning 'enormously'. The word comes from the root 'toht-', which relates to concepts of magnitude and vastness."
