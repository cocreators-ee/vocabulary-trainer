  "context": "The Estonian word 'meilt' is an adessive case form of the pronoun 'meie' (we/us). It functions as a prepositional phrase meaning 'from us' or 'from our side'. In grammatical terms, it's formed by adding '-lt' to the genitive plural form 'meid', resulting in meilt. This word is commonly used when indicating origin or source - something comes from us or is available through us."
