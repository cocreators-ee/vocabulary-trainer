  "context": "The Estonian verb 'ühineda' means to join, unite, or come together. It is typically used when referring to joining an organization, group, or cause. The word comes from the root 'ühis-' meaning 'joint' or 'common', and the '-ed' suffix indicates movement towards something. In different grammatical forms it can mean joining (active voice) or being joined (passive voice)."
