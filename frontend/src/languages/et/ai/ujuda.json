  "context": "The word 'ujuda' is the da-infinitive form of the Estonian verb 'ujuma', which means 'to swim'. It's used to express the action of swimming in water. The word appears in idiomatic expressions like 'sa ujud nagu kirves' meaning you can't swim at all, using the axe (kirves) as a metaphor for complete inability."
