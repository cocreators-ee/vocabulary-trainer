  "context": "The Estonian word 'kas' is a versatile particle used to introduce yes-or-no questions and conditional statements. It can function as a question starter ('Is it raining?'), express doubt or uncertainty ('Will he really come today?'), make tentative suggestions ('Shall we go to the garden sometime?'), issue commands or prohibitions ('Be quiet!', 'Go away!'), show surprise or indignation ('Can you see, he's here too!'), or form contrary statements ('Isn't a child also human?'). It can introduce indirect questions and subordinate clauses expressing doubt. In colloquial speech, it appears in idiomatic expressions with an emphatic function."
