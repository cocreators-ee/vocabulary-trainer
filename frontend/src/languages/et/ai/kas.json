  "context": "In Estonian, 'kas' is a question particle used at the beginning of yes/no questions. It corresponds to English words like 'whether', 'if', or 'is it that'. This word is essential for forming direct questions in Estonian and always appears sentence-initially when asking questions that expect a yes/no answer."
