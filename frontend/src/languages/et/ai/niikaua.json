  "context": "The Estonian word 'niikaua' is a temporal conjunction/adverb that means 'as long as', 'until', or 'for that amount of time'. It indicates the duration of an action or state. In its grammatical form, it appears to be used here in a manner similar to how we might use 'while' or 'during' in English, connecting two clauses where one action continues for the duration of another. The dictionary shows it can also appear as part of the phrase 'niikaua kui' (as long as if), which is similar to the conditional structure."
