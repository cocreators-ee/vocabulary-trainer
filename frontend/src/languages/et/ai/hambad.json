  "context": "The word 'hambad' is the plural form of 'hammas' which means 'tooth'. In Estonian, like many other languages, nouns have different forms for singular and plural. The root 'hamb-' refers to teeth or dental structures, and '-d' is a common plural ending in Estonian. This word is used when referring to multiple teeth rather than just one tooth."
