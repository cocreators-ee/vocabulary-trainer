  "context": "The word 'karta' is the 3rd person singular form of the Estonian verb 'kartma', which means 'to fear' or 'to be afraid of'. In dictionary definitions, we see it referenced in its adverbial form 'kardetavasti' meaning 'probably' or 'likely'. The word can be used to express fear, dread, or anxiety about something. In the example sentences, it appears both in the base form and as part of the adverbial expression."
