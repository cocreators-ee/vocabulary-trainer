  "context": "The Estonian word 'relv' means weapon or firearm. It is a common noun that can refer to any type of weapon used for attack, defense, or sport, including firearms like guns and rifles as well as other weapons like swords and spears. The word comes from the genitive case form 'relva' and has various compounds such as 'külmrelv' (cold weapon) and 'tulirelv' (firearm). It can also be used metaphorically to refer to tools or means for achieving goals, similar to how English might use 'weapon' in expressions like 'words are his weapons'."
