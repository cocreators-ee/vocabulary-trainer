  "context": "The Estonian word 'loodetavasti' is an adverb meaning 'hopefully' or 'it is hoped that'. It expresses expectation or hope about a future event. The word derives from the verb 'loomata' (to hope) with the '-a-' infix and the '-ti' suffix forming an adverb. When used in sentences, it typically appears at the beginning but can also appear elsewhere depending on emphasis."
