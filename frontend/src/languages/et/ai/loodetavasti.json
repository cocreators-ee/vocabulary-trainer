  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'loodetavasti' expresses hope or expectation about something happening. It's equivalent to English words like 'hopefully', 'it is hoped that', or 'presumably'. The word derives from the verb 'looma' (to hope) combined with a suffix indicating possibility or likelihood. In the examples, it's used to express hopeful expectations about positive outcomes - things going well, someone surviving, or arriving on time."
