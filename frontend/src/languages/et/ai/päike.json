  "context": "The Estonian word 'päike' means 'sun'. It is the star around which Earth and other planets in the solar system orbit. The word can refer to the physical sun, its light and heat, or be used metaphorically for something that brings warmth, happiness, or attention (like a person who is the center of attention). It has various forms in different grammatical cases: nominative päike, genitive päikese, partitive päikest, etc."
