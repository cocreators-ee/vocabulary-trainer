  "context": "The Estonian word 'blond' is an adjective that describes someone with fair or light-colored hair. It can be used to modify nouns (like 'blond tütarlaps' meaning 'a blonde girl') or function substantively as a noun referring to people with blond hair ('blondid' in plural form). The dictionary also shows various compound forms like 'heleblond', 'kuldblond', etc. that describe different shades of blond."
