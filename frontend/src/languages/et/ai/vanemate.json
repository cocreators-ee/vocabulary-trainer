  "context": "The word 'vanemate' is the plural genitive form of the Estonian noun 'vanem', which means 'parent'. In the genitive case, it indicates possession or relationship - so 'vanemate' specifically means 'of parents' or belonging to/related to parents. This construction is commonly used when talking about something that belongs to parents or relates to them."
