  "context": "The Estonian word 'rumal' is an adjective that primarily means stupid, foolish, or unintelligent. It describes someone who has limited understanding, is slow-witted, or lacks intelligence. The word can be used to describe both people's intellectual capacity and their foolish behavior or actions. In some contexts, it can also mean something being bad, unpleasant, or ridiculous when referring to things rather than people."
