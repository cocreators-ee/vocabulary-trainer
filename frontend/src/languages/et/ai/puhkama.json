  "context": "The Estonian word 'puhkama' has multiple related meanings: 1) to rest and recover after work or exertion, to be in peace and quiet or engage in relaxing activities; 2) to be free from duties and on vacation; 3) literally to lie dead (in a poetic/humorous context). It can be used for people resting their bodies or minds, things being at rest (like nature), and even humorously referring to death. The word comes from the verb root 'puhata' meaning to rest."
