  "context": "The Estonian verb 'lükata' has two main meanings: 1) To physically push, drive or send someone/something back. This can be used literally like driving an animal away, or figuratively like repelling an attack. 2) To deny, refuse or argue against something, particularly in the context of rejecting statements or claims. The verb implies opposition or resistance - either physical pushing back against movement or verbal pushing back against ideas."
