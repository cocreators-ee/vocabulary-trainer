  "context": "The word 'kasvanud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'kasvama', which means 'to grow'. It can be used to describe physical growth (like children growing taller), development over time, or something being raised/nurtured. In some contexts as shown in the dictionary example, it can also imply that someone has developed a particular skill or characteristic naturally, as if they were born with it."
