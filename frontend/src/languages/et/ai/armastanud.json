  ],
  "context": "The word 'armastanud' is the past perfect tense of the Estonian verb 'armastama', which means 'to love'. It indicates an action that was completed in the past, often with relevance to the present moment. In English, this would correspond to 'loved' or more specifically 'have loved'. The dictionary definition provided seems to be for a different word (hellitus meaning caress/endearment), so I'm focusing on the verb form given."
