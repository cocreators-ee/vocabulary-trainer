  "context": "The word 'lubanud' is the past tense (participle form) of the Estonian verb 'luba', which means 'to promise'. This is a common verb used to indicate that someone has made a commitment or given their word about something they will do in the future. The '-nud' ending indicates it's in the perfective aspect, suggesting the action of promising is completed but still relevant to the present."
