  "context": "The Estonian word 'ehk' has multiple functions: 1) As an adverb, it expresses hypothetical or hoped-for possibilities that aren't entirely certain (equivalent to English 'perhaps' or 'maybe'). 2) In modest speech contexts, it can soften requests. 3) As a conjunction, it connects synonymous expressions or explanations, functioning like 'a.k.a.' or 'or'. The word appears frequently in both spoken and written Estonian across these different grammatical roles."
