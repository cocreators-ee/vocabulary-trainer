  "context": "The Estonian word 'ehk' is a common adverb used to express uncertainty or possibility. It's similar to English words like 'maybe', 'perhaps', or 'possibly'. This word is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence or clause where it introduces a suggestion, alternative idea, or uncertain proposition. In spoken language, it's often pronounced with a slight emphasis on the first syllable when expressing genuine uncertainty."
