  "context": "The Estonian word 'müts' means hat or cap in English. It refers to a type of headwear that covers the top of the head and typically has a brim all around, though it can refer to various types of hats or caps depending on context. In Estonian grammar, this would be a singular noun and would take appropriate endings when used in different cases (like mütsi in genitive case)."
