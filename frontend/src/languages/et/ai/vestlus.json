  "context": "The word 'vestlus' is a feminine noun in Estonian that refers to a conversation or discussion between people. It's derived from the verb 'vestlema' (to talk/discuss). The word can be used for both casual conversations and more serious discussions, similar to how English uses 'conversation'. In Estonian grammar, it would typically be declined with -s in the genitive case when indicating possession or relation."
