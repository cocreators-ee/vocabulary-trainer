  "context": "'Milleks' is an Estonian word that functions as a postposition or interrogative adverb meaning 'for what purpose', 'why', or 'what for'. It's the inessive case form of 'miks' (why) and typically follows the noun it refers to. In questions, it asks about the reason or purpose behind an action or situation. For example, 'Milleks sa oled hilinenud?' means 'Why are you late?' literally 'For what purpose are you late?'"
