  "context": "The Estonian word 'pealik' means chief or leader. It can refer to various types of leaders including tribal chiefs (like Indian chiefs), military commanders, heads of organizations, or group leaders. The word comes from 'pea' meaning head/leader and '-lik' forming agent nouns indicating a person who does something. It's commonly used for both traditional leadership roles and organizational positions."
