  "context": "Leidsime is the past tense plural form of the Estonian verb 'leidma', which means 'to find'. In English, this translates to 'we found' or simply 'found' when the subject is clear. The word comes from the stem 'leid-' with the past tense suffix '-i-' and plural personal ending '-me', indicating that the action was performed by a group including the speaker."
