  "context": "'Temal' is the Estonian comparative form meaning 'than him' or 'compared to him'. It is used in comparative constructions when comparing someone/something else to a male person (tema - he/him). The word indicates that the subject has more of a certain quality than the male being compared to. This is part of Estonian case system where '-l' ending typically adds a locative or instrumental meaning, but here it's specifically used for comparison purposes."
