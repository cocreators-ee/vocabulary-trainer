  "context": "The word 'temal' is an Estonian instrumental case form that typically appears to be a variant of the instrumental case of 'tema' (he/him). In standard Estonian, the instrumental case of 'tema' would be 'temaga' meaning 'with him'. However, 'temal' could also be interpreted as a possessive form or dialectal variation. Given the context from movie subtitles, it might represent a specific grammatical construction used in spoken language."
