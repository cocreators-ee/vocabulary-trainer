  "context": "The Estonian word 'pime' has multiple meanings depending on context. As an adjective, it can mean 'blind' when referring to a person's inability to see (e.g., 'ta on pimedaks sündinud' - he was born blind). When describing darkness or absence of light, it means 'dark' or 'pitch-black' (e.g., 'öine taeva oli täiesti pime'). It can also refer to a state of being without sight or knowledge. The word is related to the Estonian noun 'pimedus' which means 'blindness' or 'darkness'. In some contexts, it might be used metaphorically to describe someone who lacks insight or understanding."
