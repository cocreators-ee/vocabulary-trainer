  "context": "The Estonian word 'täiega' is an adverb that means completely, fully, entirely or totally. It's formed from the root 'täie-' (meaning full/complete) with the '-ga' suffix indicating 'with'. So it literally means 'with completeness' and functions as an intensifier to emphasize something being done in full measure. The examples show its use in contexts describing explosions blowing a house completely toward the sky, giving a farm entirely to a son, and a ship sinking completely."
