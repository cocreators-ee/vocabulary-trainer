  "context": "The Estonian word 'täiega' is an adverb that means 'truly', 'really', 'indeed', or completely/fully. It's used to emphasize the degree or truthfulness of a statement, similar to how we might use words like 'very' or 'really' in English but with stronger emphasis. The word is formed from 'tõde' (truth) plus '-ie-' suffix and '-ga' which often indicates accompaniment or means 'with', so literally something like 'with truth'."
