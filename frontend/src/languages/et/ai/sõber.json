  "context": "The Estonian word 'sõber' is a noun that means 'friend'. It can refer to someone with whom you have mutual trust, sympathy, and affection. The word has different forms based on grammatical case - the genitive form is 'sõbra', partitive is 'sõpra', and plural nominative is 'sõbrad'. In Estonian culture, friendship ('sõprus') is highly valued as indicated by idioms like 'Õige sõber kaalub enam kui kuld' (A true friend weighs more than gold). The word can also be used in compound nouns to describe specific types of friends like 'koolisõber' (school friend), 'lapsepõlvesõber' (childhood friend), or 'sõbranna' (female friend)."
