  "context": "The word 'lähed' appears to be a misspelling or incomplete form of the Estonian adjective/lõik lähedal', which means 'near' or 'close by'. In Estonian, 'lähedal' is used to indicate proximity or being close in physical distance. It's commonly followed by the genitive case when specifying what something is near (e.g., 'maja lähedal' - near the house). The form given 'lähed' might be intended as a shortened version, but the complete and correct form would be 'lähedal'. However, it could also potentially be related to the verb 'lähenema' (to approach), which in some contexts might appear in this shortened form."
