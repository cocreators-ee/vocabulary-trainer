  "context": "The Estonian word 'vähemalt' is an adverb that means 'at least'. It's used to indicate a minimum amount or level. For example, when saying 'Vähemalt kolm tundi kodus olen', it means 'I am at home for at least three hours'. The word can be modified by adding suffixes like '-gi' (vähemaltgi - also at least) or used in comparative constructions."
