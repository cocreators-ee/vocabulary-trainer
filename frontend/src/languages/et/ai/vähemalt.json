  "context": "The Estonian word 'vähemalt' is an adverb that means 'at least' or 'minimum'. It's used to indicate a minimum quantity, quality, or standard. The word breaks down as 'vähem' (less) + '-lt' (adverbial suffix), literally meaning 'in a lesser degree', but used idiomatically to express the concept of 'at least'. It can be used to set a lower bound on numbers, establish minimum standards, or indicate that something is acceptable despite not being ideal."
