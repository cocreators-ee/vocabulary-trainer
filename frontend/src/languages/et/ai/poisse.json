  "context": "The Estonian word 'poisse' is the partitive plural form of 'poiss', which means 'boy'. The partitive case in Estonian indicates partialness or indefiniteness, and when used with plural nouns like 'boys', it suggests an unspecified number or some of the boys. This form is commonly used after certain verbs that require the partitive case, such as verbs expressing eating, drinking, seeing, etc."
