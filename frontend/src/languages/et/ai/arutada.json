  "context": "The Estonian verb 'arutada' means to discuss, consider, or deliberate something. It is used when people engage in conversation to examine a topic thoroughly, exchange opinions, and think about something carefully before making decisions. The word comes from the root 'aru-' which relates to understanding/reasoning, and '-tada' which indicates an action verb form."
