  "context": "The word 'vaatab' appears to be a conjugated form of the verb 'vaatama' (to watch/look at), but based on the dictionary definitions provided, it seems there might be confusion with another word. The dictionary entries refer to 'koduhoidja', which means 'house sitter' or someone who watches over home/pets in absence. Since the word given is 'vaatab' and not 'koduhoidja', I need to analyze it as a form of 'vaatama'. 'Vaatab' is 3rd person singular present tense, meaning 'he/she/it watches' or 'he/she/it looks at'."
