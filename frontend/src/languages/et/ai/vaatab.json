  "context": "The word 'vaatab' is the third-person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'vaatama', which means 'to look' or 'to watch'. It indicates someone is currently looking at something, watching television, observing an event, or paying attention to something. In Estonian grammar, this is formed by dropping the '-ma' ending from the infinitive and adding '-b' for third person singular present tense."
