  "context": "The word 'arvamust' is the partitive case form of 'arvamus', which means 'opinion' or 'viewpoint'. In Estonian, the partitive case often indicates an incomplete action or unspecified quantity. When asking for someone's opinion (mis sa arvad?), you're essentially asking what they think about something. The word appears frequently in contexts where subjective views are being expressed or sought."
