  "context": "The word 'muretsen' appears to be used in this Estonian text as a verb form meaning 'to worry' or 'be concerned about'. In the sentence 'Peaksin rõõmustama, aga hoopiski muretsen', it translates roughly to 'I should be happy, but on the contrary I'm worrying.' The word is used with 'hoopiski' (still/yet) to indicate a contrast between expectation and reality. As a verb, 'muretsen' is likely from the root 'murde-' meaning worry or concern, conjugated in the first person singular present tense."
