  "context": "The word 'kedagi' is the partitive case form of the Estonian pronoun 'keegi', meaning 'anyone' or 'somebody'. In Estonian, the partitive case is used to indicate an incomplete action, existence, or object. This form would be used when someone doesn't come, or asking about a person in a non-specific way, indicating that we're talking about some person (not necessarily all persons)."
