  "context": "Kuid is an Estonian conjunction used to connect clauses or sentences that have contrasting ideas. It can be translated as 'but', 'however', or 'although' in English. The word introduces a contrast between two elements, whether they're directly opposite (like young vs old) or simply different (like warm weather but windy). Kuid appears in several grammatical contexts: it can connect coordinate clauses, repeat sentence elements for emphasis, or start an independent sentence to link with the previous context."
