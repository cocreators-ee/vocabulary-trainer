  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuid' is a conjunction that functions similarly to English words like 'however', 'but', or 'yet'. It's used to contrast ideas or introduce alternative perspectives in sentences. In the examples, it appears as 'kuidas' (how) when combined with question words, but in its basic form 'kuid' stands alone to connect contrasting thoughts."
