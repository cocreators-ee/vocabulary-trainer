  "context": "The word 'minusse' is an Estonian greeting used when parting ways. It's a contraction of the longer expression 'Minu seest', which literally means 'from me' but has evolved into a common way to say goodbye in informal contexts. This greeting is similar in function to English 'bye' or 'goodbye', and it's often used with an exclamation mark for emphasis."
