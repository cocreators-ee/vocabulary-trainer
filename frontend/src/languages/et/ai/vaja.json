  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaja' is an adverb that indicates a need or necessity for something. It's commonly used to express what is needed, required, or necessary in various contexts - from physical objects and people to actions and conditions. The word often appears after the noun it relates to (unlike English where 'needed' typically comes before). For example: 'tööjõudu vaja' means 'workforce is needed', 'abilisi pole vaja' means 'helpers are not needed'. It's a very common and essential word in Estonian daily language."
