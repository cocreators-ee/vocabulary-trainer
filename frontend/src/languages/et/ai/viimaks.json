  "context": "The Estonian word 'viimaks' is an adverb that means 'finally', 'at last', or 'in the end'. It's used to indicate that something has happened after a period of waiting, delay, or expectation. The word comes from 'viimane' (last) with the '-ks' suffix, which in Estonian can indicate direction or result. So literally it could be interpreted as 'to the last point' or 'reaching the end', which aligns well with its meaning of finally achieving something after a process."
