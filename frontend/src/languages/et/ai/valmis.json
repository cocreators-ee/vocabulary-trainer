  "context": "The Estonian word 'valmis' is a versatile adjective that can mean ready, completed, prepared, or finished depending on the context. It can describe physical completion (a house being built), mental preparedness (being ready for battle), willingness to do something, or even refer to someone who has died (colloquially). The word changes form based on grammatical case and number, with genitive 'valmi', partitive 'valmit', and plural forms like 'valmid'. It's commonly used in compound words such as 'stardivalmis' (ready for starting) or 'sõiduvalmis' (ready to drive)."
