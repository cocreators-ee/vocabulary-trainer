It can refer to different breeds (Przewalski's Arabian, Ardennes, Estonian, Finnish, Tori horses), various coat colors (chestnut, bay, black, white, gray, dun), and describes both physical characteristics and actions of horses like neighing, breathing, trotting, etc. The word also appears in many compound words to specify types of horses (aisahobune - draft horse, juhthobune - coach horse, jõudehobune - working horse, etc.)."
