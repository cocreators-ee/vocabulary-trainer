  "context": "The word 'müüs' is the past tense form of the verb 'müüma', which means 'to sell'. It indicates that an action of selling has already been completed. This third-person singular past form would translate to English as 'sold' or in some contexts could relate to 'sells' depending on context, though primarily it's the simple past tense."
