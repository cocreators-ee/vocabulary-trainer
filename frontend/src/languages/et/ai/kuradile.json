  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuradile' means 'to the devil' or refers to selling one's soul to the devil. It is used in contexts where someone makes a pact with evil forces, often metaphorically for making bad deals or compromises that have negative consequences. The dictionary example shows it used in the context of drinking excessively and selling one's soul to Satan."
