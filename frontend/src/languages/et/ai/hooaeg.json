  "context": "Hooaeg is an Estonian noun meaning 'season' or a specific period of time when certain activities occur. It's formed from the root words 'hoog' (impetus) and 'aeg' (time). The word can refer to recurring periods like winter, summer, spring, autumn seasons, as well as activity-specific periods such as sports seasons, harvest times, or theatrical performance periods. In grammar, it follows declension patterns typical of Estonian nouns with genitive form 'hooaja', partitive 'hooaega', and plural forms including 'hooajad' (nominative) and 'hooaegu' (partitive)."
