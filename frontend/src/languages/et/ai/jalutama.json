  "context": "The Estonian word 'jalutama' means to walk or stroll, typically done for pleasure, relaxation, or entertainment. It describes the act of moving slowly on foot, often in a leisurely manner. The verb is used both for human walking and can sometimes be used figuratively. The dictionary examples show it being used with various subjects (people walking alone, together, or even animals) and different locations (parks, streets, around cities)."
