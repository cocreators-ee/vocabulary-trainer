  "context": "Päris is an Estonian adverb that functions as both a degree intensifier and a marker of reality or truth. It can mean 'quite' or 'rather' when modifying qualities, but also 'really', 'truly', or 'actually' when emphasizing the authenticity or truthfulness of something. When used with verbs, it indicates completion or thoroughness. In some contexts, it conveys a sense of being genuine or authentic rather than fake or superficial."
