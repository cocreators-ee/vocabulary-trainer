  "context": "The Estonian word 'tõsi' is a versatile term that functions as both a noun meaning 'truth' and an adjective/adverb meaning 'true' or 'real'. It can be used to refer to factual reality (as in wanting to know the truth), confirm statements (meaning 'indeed' or 'for sure'), or describe something as being authentic or genuine. The word has different forms depending on grammatical case - nominative singular is 'tõsi', genitive is 'tõe', partitive is 'tõtt'. It's often used in expressions confirming the validity of what has been said, similar to how 'true' functions in English but with broader application."
