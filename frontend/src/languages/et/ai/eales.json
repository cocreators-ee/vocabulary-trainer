  "context": "The Estonian word 'eales' is an adverb used to express the concept of never or ever at any point in time. It can be used in both negative sentences (like 'we have never had arguments') and positive statements (like 'I will do whatever you ever want'). This word emphasizes completeness over a period of time - referring to all past, present, and future occasions."
