  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunniga' is a postposition that means 'with an hour' or 'within an hour'. It indicates a timeframe associated with movement, arrival, or departure. The form '-ga' typically means 'with', but in this context, it combines with 'tunn' (hour) to indicate time rather than companionship. This construction is commonly used when specifying approximate times of travel, events, or deadlines."
