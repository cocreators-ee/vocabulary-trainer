  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunniga' is an adverb that means gradually or little by little. It indicates a slow, incremental change over time. The word comes from the noun 'tund' (hour), and when used with the suffix '-ga', it creates a temporal meaning indicating something happening progressively rather than abruptly."
