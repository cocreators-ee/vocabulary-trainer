  "context": "The word 'toas' is the inessive case of Estonian word 'toa', meaning 'in the room'. The inessive case indicates location inside something. It's formed by adding '-s' to the genitive form of 'toa'. In English, this would translate to expressions like 'in the room', but in Estonian grammar it becomes a separate form."
