  "context": "The word 'toas' is an Estonian inessive case form of the noun 'tuba,' meaning 'room.' It typically translates to 'in the room' when referring to a specific location. In some contexts, especially colloquial or informal speech, it can also mean 'at home' if the room refers to one's living space."
