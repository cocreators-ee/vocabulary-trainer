  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuulma' is a versatile verb with several meanings. Its primary meaning is 'to hear' using the sense of hearing, but it also extends to 'being aware of information,' 'listening to advice or commands,' and functioning as an attention-getter in speech ('Kuule!/Listen!'). The dictionary shows five main categories: physical perception of sounds, becoming informed about something, heeding advice/commands, historical usage (variant form), and as a speech formula. It's important to note that 'kuulma' is the basic verb form, while 'kuulen' indicates first person singular present tense ('I hear')."
