  "context": "The Estonian word 'armastatud' is related to the adjective 'armas' (beloved, dear, lovely). While 'armastatud' specifically means beloved or cherished in a more formal way (being the past participle form of 'armastama' - to love), it's closely connected to 'armas' which is commonly used as an affectionate term. The word expresses deep affection and endearment, often used for loved ones, pets, things that are dear to one's heart, or even as a polite term of address. It can describe someone as beloved, sweet, charming, or dear."
