  "context": "The Estonian word 'tähtsam' is the comparative form of 'tähtis', meaning 'important' or 'significant'. It indicates that something has a higher degree of importance compared to other things. The dictionary shows it can be used in contexts where someone or something is considered the most important element ('a ja o') - essentially saying they are 'the be-all and end-all' of a situation. In English, this corresponds to words like 'more important', 'more significant', or 'weightier'."
