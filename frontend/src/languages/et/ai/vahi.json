  "context": "The word 'vahi' in Estonian refers to a state of being guarded, supervised, or held in custody. It can refer to physical security measures like having guards watching over someone/something, or it can be used more broadly to describe the condition of being under supervision or control. The word can appear in different contexts such as 'vahi all' (under guard/custody) and is related to concepts of protection but also restriction of freedom."
