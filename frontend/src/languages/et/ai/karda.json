  "context": "The word 'karda' is a verb in Estonian that means 'to fear' or 'to be afraid of'. It's the present indicative connegative form and second-person singular present imperative form of the verb 'kartma'. The dictionary provides examples like 'Ei karda hunti ega tonti' which translates to 'doesn't fear a wolf or a ghost', meaning 'doesn't fear anyone'. This shows that 'karda' is used in contexts where someone fears something or someone else."
