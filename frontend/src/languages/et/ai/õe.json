  "context": "The word 'õe' has two main uses in Estonian. First, it is the genitive singular form of 'õde', meaning 'sister'. Second, it's used as an interjection to address or attract someone's attention, similar to saying 'hey sister' or 'come on sister' in English. It appears to be an informal way to call out to a female sibling or woman."
