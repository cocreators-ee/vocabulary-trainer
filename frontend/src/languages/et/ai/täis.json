  "context": "The Estonian word 't채is' is an adjective that means 'full', 'filled', or 'complete'. It describes something that has reached its capacity, whether it's a container filled to the brim, a place crowded with people, or a situation where no more can be added. The word doesn't change form for gender but may need to agree in number with the noun it modifies."
