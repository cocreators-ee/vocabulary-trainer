  "context": "The Estonian word 'tee' has multiple meanings. Primarily it means 'road' or 'way' - a physical path for walking or driving (like 'suur, lai tee' meaning 'a large, wide road'). It also refers to routes or directions ('lühim tee poodi läheb otse üle põllu' meaning 'the shortest route to the store goes straight across the field'). Figuratively, it can mean a method, approach, or way of doing things ('tee lahenduseni' meaning 'a way to a solution') or even someone's life path or career trajectory ('kunstniku loominguline tee' meaning 'an artist's creative path'). The word has different cases in Estonian grammar - the nominative form is 'tee', genitive is 'teede', partitive is 'teed', etc."
