  "context": "\"Omale\" is an Estonian pronoun that means \"for oneself,\" \"to oneself,\" or simply \"oneself.\" It is in the allative case, indicating direction or destination - something being done or going toward oneself. The word emphasizes personal possession or benefit, as opposed to doing something for others. In English translations, it might appear as \"for myself/himself/herself/etc.\" depending on context."
