  "context": "The word 'omale' in Estonian typically means 'to oneself' or indicates independence/self-reliance. It often appears with the word 'jalale' (feet) to mean 'standing on one's own feet' or becoming independent. The phrase 'iseseisvaks, omale jõule toetuvaks' translates to 'independent and self-sufficient'. This term is used when someone becomes financially or emotionally independent, no longer relying on others for support."
