  "context": "The word 'arvate' is the 2nd person plural form of the Estonian verb 'arvama', which means to think, believe, or suppose. It's used when addressing multiple people (you/think). In English, this would correspond to 'you all think' or 'y'all think'. The root word 'arva-' is related to thinking and forming opinions."
