  "context": "The word 'turvalisuse' is the elative case form of the Estonian noun 'turvalisus', which means safety or security. The elative case (-se ending) indicates movement out from something, so 'turvalisuse' can be translated as 'from safety' or 'out of safety'. However, in many contexts it's used more generally to refer to the concept of safety/security itself. It is formed by adding the suffix '-us' (forming an abstract noun meaning state/quality) to 'turvaline' (safe), and then the elative case ending '-se'."
