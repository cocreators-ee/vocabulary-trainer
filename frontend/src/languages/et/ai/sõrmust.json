  "context": "The word 'sõrmust' is the elative form of the verb 'rõngastama'. It means to put a ring around something, particularly used for marking birds by placing rings on their legs. In colloquial usage, it can also mean to marry someone (by putting a wedding ring on their finger). The word comes from 'sõrmus' meaning ring, and the '-tum-' suffix indicates action or process."
