  "context": "In Estonian, 'puhata' is an informal or colloquial term that means to stretch or straighten one's back, particularly in the context of relieving back pain or tension. It can also refer to the physical action of arching or extending the spine backward. The word appears as an alternative form (ka:) next to 'selga sirgu ajada' (to make one's back straight) and 'selja sirutada' (to stretch one's back), indicating it serves a similar function in everyday language. This verb is commonly used when someone feels the need to relieve back stiffness or discomfort."
