  "context": "The word 'emale' in Estonian is the 3rd person singular form of the verb 'elama', which means 'to live'. However, based on context and usage patterns, it can also be used as an imperative form meaning 'remember!' or it could be a variant/misspelling of 'male' (pronounced similarly) which means 'male' in English. In many contexts from subtitles, it appears to function as an interjection similar to 'remember!'"
