  "context": "The Estonian word 'kellega' is a colloquial term that refers to someone who drinks alcohol together with you, essentially a drinking companion or bar buddy. It's often used in informal contexts and suggests a relationship where people regularly drink together. The term can carry both neutral and slightly negative connotations depending on the context - it might simply refer to a friend you go out for drinks with, but could also imply someone who engages heavily in alcohol consumption."
