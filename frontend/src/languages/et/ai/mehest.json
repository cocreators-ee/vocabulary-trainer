  "context": "'Mehest' is the elative singular form of the Estonian word 'mees', which means 'man'. The elative case indicates movement or origin from somewhere, so 'mehest' translates to 'from a man' or 'out of a man'. It's used when indicating that something comes from or originates from a male person. In the dictionary definition, it also appears in the phrase 'kümnest mehest koosnev kolleegium' which means 'a college consisting of ten men'."
