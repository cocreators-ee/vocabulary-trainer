  "context": "The word 'mehest' is an Estonian prepositional case form derived from the word 'mees' (man). It's in the elative case, which indicates movement or origin away from something. In English, it would typically be translated as 'from the man', 'of the man', or 'out of the man'. This form is used when indicating where someone or something comes from or originates."
