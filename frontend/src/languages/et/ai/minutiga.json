  "context": "The Estonian word 'minutiga' is an adverbial form that indicates something happening progressively or gradually over minutes. It's formed from the root 'minuti' (minute) with the '-ga' suffix, which in Estonian can indicate accompaniment, manner, or means. The word suggests a continuous but steady progression rather than rapid change. It appears to be related to the dictionary entry showing 'minut-minutilt' as an alternative form, both expressing the idea of something developing minute by minute over time."
