  "context": "The word 'minutiga' in Estonian is the adessive case form of 'minute', which means 'with minute'. It's commonly used to express that something will happen in or after a short period of time, similar to saying 'in a minute' or 'momentarily' in English. The '-ga' suffix indicates the adessive case, often translating to 'with' but in this temporal context it functions as 'within/in'."
