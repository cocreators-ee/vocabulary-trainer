  "context": "The word 'linnapea' in Estonian translates to 'mayor' in English. It is a compound word formed from 'linn' (city) + 'pea' (head), literally meaning 'city head'. This refers to the person who leads or governs a city, similar to how a mayor functions as the chief executive of a municipality."
