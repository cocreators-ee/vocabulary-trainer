  "context": "\"Ette\" is a versatile Estonian word with multiple meanings depending on context. As an adverb, it means 'in advance' or 'ahead'. As a postposition, it means 'in front of' or 'before'. It can indicate direction (moving forward), preparation (getting something ready), time (in advance), position (in front), or purpose (for someone's benefit). The word appears to derive from \"ees\" meaning front. Examples show its use in physical movement ('took two steps ahead'), preparation ('prepares lectures'), and transportation ('train went forward')."
