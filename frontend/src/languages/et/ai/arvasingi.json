  "context": "The word 'arvasingi' is an Estonian adverb that means 'by mistake', 'erroneously', or 'incorrectly'. It describes doing something accidentally or incorrectly, often when one has made an error in judgment or action. The word comes from the verb 'arvama' (to think/suppose) and '-ingi' which forms adverbs of manner. This construction indicates that an action was performed based on incorrect thinking or assumption."
