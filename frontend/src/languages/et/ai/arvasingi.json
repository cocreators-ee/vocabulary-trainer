  "context": "The word 'arvasingi' is the adverbial form of 'ära arvama', which means to guess or figure something out. It modifies the verb by indicating that the guessing was done successfully or completely. In English, it could be translated as 'completely guessed,' 'fully figured out,' or 'successfully deduced.' The word derives from 'arvama' (to calculate/reckon) with the negative particle 'är-' and the adverbial ending '-singi'."
