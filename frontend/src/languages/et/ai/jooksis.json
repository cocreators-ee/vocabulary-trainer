  "context": "The word 'jooksis' is the past tense third person singular form of the Estonian verb 'jooksma', which means 'to run'. It indicates that someone or something ran in the past. In English, this would be translated as 'ran' or 'was running'. The word changes its ending based on tense and subject - '-is' is a typical past tense suffix for third person singular verbs in Estonian."
