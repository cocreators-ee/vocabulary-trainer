  "context": "The Estonian word 'masin' has two main meanings: 1) A machine or device that eases and enhances physical or mental work, which can refer to any type of machinery from industrial equipment to household appliances. It's a very broad term for mechanical devices. 2) Informally, it means car or automobile. The word comes from German 'Maschine' and ultimately from Latin 'machina'. In Estonian grammar, it declines as a masculine noun (type 2/õpik, no gradation)."
