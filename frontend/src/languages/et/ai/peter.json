  "context": "The word 'peter' appears to be a proper name (first name) in the given Estonian sentences. It is used as a subject referring to an individual named Peter who does not belong to the group of men who can be convinced or persuaded by words, and in another context, it seems to refer to someone related to weather conditions ('Kui ilm annab' - 'If the weather gives'). However, without more contextual information, this appears to primarily function as a personal name."
