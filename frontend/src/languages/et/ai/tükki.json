  "context": "The Estonian word 'tükki' is an adverb that indicates something has been broken or separated into pieces. It's used to describe the result of a breaking process, similar to English expressions like 'into pieces', 'to bits', or 'apart'. The three example sentences show different contexts: sugar melting/clumping (suhkur on tükki sulanud - sugar melted/broke into clumps), clay being squeezed in hand (pigistas savi peos tükki - squeezed the clay in hand to pieces), and semolina porridge getting lumpy/curdled (mannapuder läks tükki - the semolina porridge went bad/lumpy)."
