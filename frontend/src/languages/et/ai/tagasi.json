  "context": "\"Tagasi\" is a versatile Estonian adverb with multiple meanings. It primarily means 'back' or 'backward' in terms of direction and movement (e.g., taking a step back, turning your head back). It also indicates return to a starting point or former situation (e.g., coming back from somewhere, going back and forth between places). As a postposition with time expressions, it means 'ago' referring to past events. Additionally, it can indicate retaliation ('in return'), movement toward the past ('back in time'), or restoration to a previous state."
