  "context": "The Estonian word 'tagant' is an adverb that means 'from behind' or 'from the back'. It indicates location, direction, or origin from the rear part of something or someone. In grammar, it's formed as the exessive case ('excessiveness') of the word 'taga' (meaning 'behind'). The word can be used to describe physical position (someone coming from behind), temporal distance (something happening after a certain time interval), or to indicate that something follows in sequence or originates from someone/something else."
