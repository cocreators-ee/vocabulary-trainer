  "context": "The Estonian word 'ah' is an interjection that expresses various emotions depending on context. It can show joy/excitement ('Ah! Kui tore ilm on täna!' - Ah, what nice weather today!), longing/desire ('Ah, küll tahaks praegu kodus olla!' - Ah, how I'd like to be home now!), or function as a question particle at the end of questions ('Mis sa selle peale kostad, ah?' - What do you say about that, ah?). The word 'yeah' in English is similar but more commonly used for agreement, while Estonian 'ah' serves primarily as an emotional expression rather than confirmation."
