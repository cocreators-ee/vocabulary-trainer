It's used when you're speaking to one person and referring to what they did in the past. For example, if someone watched a movie yesterday, you could say \"Sa vaatasid seda filmi eile öösel\" (You watched that movie last night). The verb is commonly used for both casual looking and more focused viewing activities."
