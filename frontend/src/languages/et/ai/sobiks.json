  "context": "The word 'sobiks' is the elative case form of 'sobiv', meaning 'suitable' or 'appropriate'. In Estonian grammar, the elative case typically indicates movement out of something or separation. So 'sobiks' can be translated as 'from being suitable' or 'out of being appropriate', but in context it's often used to express that something would not be suitable for someone (as in the example sentence)."
