  "context": "The Estonian word 'seal' is an adverb that means 'there', indicating a location that is farther away from the speaker. It's often used as a counterpart to 'siin' (here). The word can refer to both physical places and situations, and in some contexts can express modal relationships like concession or mild criticism."
