  "context": "The word 'mõtled' is the second person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'mõtlema', which means 'to think'. It is used when addressing someone directly (you) and indicating that they are thinking or considering something in the present moment. The root word 'mõtle-' relates to cognitive processes, and '-d' is the personal ending for second person singular. In Estonian, verb conjugation follows regular patterns based on vowel harmony and consonant gradation."
