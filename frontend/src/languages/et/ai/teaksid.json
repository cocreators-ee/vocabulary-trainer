  "context": "The word 'teaksid' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'teda', meaning 'to know'. It specifically translates to 'you would know' or 'if you knew' in English. This is a past conditional form, used when expressing hypothetical situations or polite requests in the past tense. In the example sentence 'Kui sa teaksid, kui kallis sa mulle oled!', it means 'If you knew how dear/precious you are to me!' showing both the conditional nature and an emotional context."
