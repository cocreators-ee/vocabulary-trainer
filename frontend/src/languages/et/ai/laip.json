  "context": "The Estonian word 'laip' means corpse or dead body. It's a noun that refers to the physical remains of a deceased person. The word can be used in various grammatical forms - genitive singular is 'laiba', partitive is 'laipa'. In colloquial usage, it can also metaphorically refer to a 'living corpse' - someone who is physically and/or mentally ruined. The word was coined by Johannes Aavik in 1917."
