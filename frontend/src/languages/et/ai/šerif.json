  "context": "The Estonian word 'šerif' is a direct loanword from English, meaning the same as 'sheriff'. In Estonia, this term refers to a law enforcement officer, typically in rural areas or smaller towns who has police powers and judicial functions. The spelling with 'š' instead of 'sh' follows Estonian orthography rules where š represents the /ʃ/ sound."
