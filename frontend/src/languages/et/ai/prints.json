  "context": "The Estonian word 'prints' means prince and refers to the male member of a royal family. It can also be used in an idealized sense to refer to an admirable man, similar to saying someone is one's dream prince. The word follows Estonian declension patterns with genitive form 'printsi', partitive 'printsi', and various other case forms."
