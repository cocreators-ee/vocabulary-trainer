  "context": "The word 'vihkab' is a form of the Estonian verb 'vihatsema' (to hate) in third person singular present tense. However, based on the dictionary definitions provided, it appears that 'vihkab' might be a misspelling or variant of 'vaenlane', which means 'enemy'. The dictionary shows multiple example sentences using 'vaenlane' as an enemy or adversary, someone who is hostile toward another person or entity. In Estonian grammar, '-b' at the end of verbs typically indicates third person singular present tense, suggesting this might be a verb form rather than the noun 'enemy'. However, without additional context confirming whether this is indeed a verb form of 'to hate', I'll focus on the most likely interpretation based on the dictionary entries provided."
