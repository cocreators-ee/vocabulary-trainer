  "context": "The word 'nüüdseks' is an Estonian adverb that indicates passage of time up until the present moment. It's formed from 'nüüd' (now) with the suffix '-seks', which in Estonian often indicates temporal progression or completion of an action up to a certain point. This word typically appears in sentences where something has been happening over time and we're referring to the current state or accumulated result."
