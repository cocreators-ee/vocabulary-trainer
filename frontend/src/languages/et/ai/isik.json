  "context": "The Estonian word 'isik' has multiple meanings. It primarily means 'person' or 'individual' - a single human being or member of a group. It can also refer to important or influential people (figures), and in grammatical terms, it refers to the three persons (first person, second person, third person) in language. In legal contexts, it denotes rights-bearers (physical or juridical persons). The word derives from 'ise' (self) + '-k'. It declines regularly as a type 2/õpik noun with forms like isiku (genitive), isikut (partitive), etc."
