  "context": "The Estonian word 'täielikult' is an adverb that means completely, fully, entirely or totally. It is formed from the adjective 'täieline' (complete) by adding the adverbial suffix '-lt', which is a common way to form adverbs in Estonian when modifying how something is done. The word indicates that something has been done in its entirety without any parts missing or left undone."
