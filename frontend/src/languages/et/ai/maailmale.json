  "context": "The word 'maapealne' is an adjective that means 'earthly', 'worldly', or 'terrestrial'. It refers to things that exist on the surface of the Earth as opposed to underground or in other realms like heaven. The suffix '-ne' makes it an adjective, and it can be declined into various forms including the comparative form 'maapealisem' (more earthly/worldly) and superlative 'maapealim' (most earthly/worldly). In the example sentences provided, we see it used in different contexts: describing earthly life, spacecraft being controlled from Earth-based command posts, and monks giving up worldly pleasures."
