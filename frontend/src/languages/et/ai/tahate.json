  "context": "The word 'tahate' is the second person plural form of the Estonian verb 'tahtma', meaning 'to want' or 'to wish'. It is used when addressing multiple people (formal or informal) and indicates desire or preference. In English, this translates to 'you want', 'you wish', or 'you would like'. The word follows the standard Estonian conjugation pattern where the infinitive form ends in '-ma', and present tense first person plural is 'tahame' (we want), while second person plural becomes 'tahate'."
