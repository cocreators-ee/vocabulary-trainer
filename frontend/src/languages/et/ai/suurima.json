  "context": "The word 'suurima' is the superlative form of the Estonian adjective 'suur', which means 'big' or 'large'. As a superlative, it indicates the biggest, largest, or greatest in comparison to others. It's formed by adding the suffix '-ma' to the stem and then the partitive case ending '-a', making it the partitive form of the superlative. This form is typically used when referring to the object being compared as the most prominent one among alternatives."
