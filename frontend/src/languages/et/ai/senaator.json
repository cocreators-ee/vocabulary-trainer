  "context": "The Estonian word 'senaator' means 'senator' in English. It refers to a member of a senate, which is typically the upper house of a legislative body or parliament. In Estonia, this term would refer to members of the Riigikogu (parliament) if they serve in an upper chamber role, though Estonia has a unicameral system."
