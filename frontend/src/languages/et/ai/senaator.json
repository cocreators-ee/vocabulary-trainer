  "context": "The word 'senaator' is an Estonian noun meaning a member of a senate or legislative body. It's the direct equivalent of English 'senator'. In Estonia, this term refers to members of the upper house of parliament (Riigikogu), similar to how it's used in other countries with bicameral legislatures. The word follows Estonian noun declension patterns with -i for plural and various case endings."
