  "context": "The word 'liikumist' is the partitive singular form of 'liikumine'. Based on dictionary definitions, it refers to slow or gradual movement. The root 'liikum-' relates to movement (motion), and the suffix '-ist' in this context indicates a slowing down process. It's often used to describe deliberate, unhurried movements as opposed to fast motion."
