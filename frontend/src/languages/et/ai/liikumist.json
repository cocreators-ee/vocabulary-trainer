  "context": "The word 'liikumist' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'liikumine', which means 'movement' or 'motion'. In English, it would be translated as 'movement,' 'motion,' or 'moving.' The partitive case in Estonian typically indicates an incomplete action, object, or something that doesn't have a complete whole. It is often used with negations and to indicate partial aspects of activities."
