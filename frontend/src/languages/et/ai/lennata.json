  "context": "The Estonian word 'lennata' is a verb that means 'to fly'. It can refer to flying as in birds soaring through the air, or more commonly for humans traveling by airplane. The word comes from the root 'lend-' which relates to flight. In different contexts it can be used for both literal flight (like an airplane taking off) and metaphorical expressions about moving quickly through the air."
