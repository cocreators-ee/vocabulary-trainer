  "context": "The word 'inimesed' is the nominative plural form of 'inimene', which means 'person' or 'human being'. In Estonian, when you want to refer to people in general or a group of individuals, you use the plural form. The word comes from 'inim-' (related to human) and '-esed' (plural ending). This is commonly used to describe groups of people in various contexts, both literally as human beings and figuratively as decent individuals with good qualities."
