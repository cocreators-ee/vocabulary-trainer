  "context": "The word 'olukorras' is an Estonian adverbial expression that indicates being in or within certain conditions, circumstances, or situations. It's formed from the root word 'olukord' (situation) with the case ending '-s', indicating location or state. The word can describe various states of being - good, bad, difficult, urgent, etc., depending on what precedes it. This is a versatile expression used in many contexts to specify the condition someone or something is in."
