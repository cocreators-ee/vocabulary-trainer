  "context": "The Estonian word 'halvasti' is an adverb that means 'badly' or 'poorly'. It describes the manner in which something is done, indicating poor quality, incorrectness, or unfavorably. The word comes from the adjective 'halb' (bad) with the '-sti' suffix typically used to form adverbs in Estonian."
