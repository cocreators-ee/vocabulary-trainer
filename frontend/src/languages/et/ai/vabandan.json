  "context": "The Estonian verb 'vabandan' has multiple related meanings: 1) To apologize or ask for forgiveness (apologize, excuse me), often used with reflexive pronouns like 'mind', 'teid', etc. 2) To justify or make excuses for something/someone using specific reasons. It's commonly used in formal apologies and can refer to both asking for forgiveness from someone AND forgiving them (as seen in the dictionary example where it means 'I forgive you'). The word is frequently used with polite forms like 'vabandage' (formal/plural apology) and 'vabanda' (singular/informal apology)."
