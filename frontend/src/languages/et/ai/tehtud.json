  "context": "The Estonian word 'tehtud' is the past participle form of the verb 'tegema', which means 'to do' or 'to make'. It functions as an adjective indicating that something has been completed, accomplished, or finished. In English, it corresponds to words like 'done', 'completed', or 'finished'. This form is commonly used in Estonian to indicate a completed action, similar to the past participle in English but often functioning more like a state descriptor."
