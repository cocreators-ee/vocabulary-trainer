  "context": "The word 'sinuta' is an Estonian adverb or postposition that means 'without' or 'lacking'. It's formed from the root 'sinu-' (related to 'sinu', meaning your) combined with '-ta', which in Estonian is a common suffix indicating absence or lack. In the given example sentence, it appears in context comparing something to being like a mill without its steering beam ('emapuu'), implying a situation where essential components are missing."
