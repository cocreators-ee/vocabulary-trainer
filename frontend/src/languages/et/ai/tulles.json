  "context": "The Estonian word 'tulles' is the des-form (adverbial participle) of the verb 'tulema', which means 'to come'. It functions as a verbal adverb that indicates an action happening at the same time as another action, similar to English '-ing' forms when used with auxiliary verbs. The word shows movement towards the speaker or a reference point and is commonly used to describe simultaneous actions in compound sentences."
