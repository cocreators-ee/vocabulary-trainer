  "context": "The Estonian word 'hoida' is a versatile verb that means to hold, keep, or maintain something. It can refer to physically holding an object (like holding a book), keeping something safe (keeping valuables secure), maintaining relationships (keeping friends/family), or preserving conditions (maintaining order). The conjugation changes depending on the subject - 'hoian' for I hold, 'hoidke' for you plural/formal keep. It's commonly used in everyday Estonian for both literal and figurative meanings of keeping or holding something."
