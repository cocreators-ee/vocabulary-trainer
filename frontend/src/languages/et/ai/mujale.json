  "context": "The word 'mujale' is an Estonian adverb that means 'to another place', 'elsewhere', or 'somewhere else'. It indicates movement from one location to a different, unspecified location. The dictionary definitions provide several examples showing how it's used with verbs of motion like 'minema' (to go), such as 'Kolime siit kuhugi mujale' (We're moving here somewhere else). It can also be used in contexts where something or someone moves to another position, not just geographical locations. The word is derived from 'muu' (other) with the adessive case suffix '-le' indicating direction towards."
