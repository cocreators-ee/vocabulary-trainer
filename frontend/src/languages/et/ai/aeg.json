  "context": "The Estonian word 'aeg' is a versatile noun that primarily means 'time' in English. It can refer to the concept of time as an abstract concept (like 'time flies'), specific periods or durations ('he worked for a certain period as a teacher'), and appropriate moments for action ('it's time for us to start'). The word also appears in numerous compound words referring to different historical eras, seasons of the year, and specific timeframes. In grammar, it can refer to verb tenses (tempus)."
