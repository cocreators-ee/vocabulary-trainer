  "context": "The Estonian word 'pagana' has multiple meanings: 1) As the genitive singular form of 'pagan', it refers to a non-Christian, polytheistic person or someone detached from church; 2) As an interjection, it's used as a mild curse or intensifier similar to English 'darn', 'damn', or 'heck'. It can express negative emotions, surprise, emphasis, or admiration. The word derives from the concept of paganism but has evolved into a common colloquial expression in everyday speech."
