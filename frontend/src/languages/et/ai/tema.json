  "context": "The word 'tema' is the third-person singular pronoun in Estonian. It can mean 'he', 'she', or 'it' depending on the gender of the person being referred to. In sentences, it follows the same grammatical rules as English pronouns but is used consistently regardless of gender until context makes it clear which gender is being discussed."
