  "context": "The Estonian word 'tema' is a stressed form of the third person singular personal pronoun used to refer to someone who is neither the speaker nor the listener. It corresponds to English 'he/she' or 'him/her'. When unstressed, it shortens to 'ta'. The word has multiple case forms including temast (from him/her), talle (to him/her), tal (at/on him/her), etc., used depending on grammatical context."
