  "context": "The word 'viite' appears to be a typo or misrepresentation in the provided dictionary entry. Based on the context and usage examples shown, it seems the intended word is actually 'alt', which means 'under', 'beneath', or 'below' in Estonian. The word 'alt' is used as a postposition (after genitive case) to indicate position under something physically (like under a table) or figuratively (from under control). It can also be used adverbially meaning from below or underneath."
