  "context": "In Estonian, 'aimu' is a noun that refers to intuition or a hunch. It can be used in different contexts such as having an intuitive feeling about something, making an educated guess based on instinct, or referring to one's natural instincts. The word appears in both singular and plural forms (like 'aimud'), and it often carries the connotation of something that comes from within rather than being logically derived."
