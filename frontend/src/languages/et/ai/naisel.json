  "context": "The word 'naisel' is the adessive case form of 'naine', which means 'woman' or 'female'. In Estonian grammar, the adessive case typically indicates location near something (similar to English 'on' or 'at') but can also be used for possession or relationship. Here it appears to indicate a woman has something or is in a certain state."
