  "context": "The Estonian word 'vastu' is a highly versatile postposition and preposition that can function as an adverb in different contexts. It primarily indicates physical contact or opposition against something, direction toward someone/something to meet them, comparison versus another entity, or support/leaning against something. Its grammatical behavior depends on the context - it governs genitive/allative case when used as a postposition and partitive case when used as a preposition."
