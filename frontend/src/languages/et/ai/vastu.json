  "context": "The Estonian word 'vastu' is a postposition that indicates direction, opposition, or response. It can be translated as 'against', 'towards', 'in response to', or 'versus'. When used with verbs of motion like 'tulla' (to come) or 'minna' (to go), it shows movement toward something. In opposition contexts, it indicates being against something or someone. The word also appears in legal or formal contexts meaning 'against' as in a case versus another party."
