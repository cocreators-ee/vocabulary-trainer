  "context": "Väikest is the partitive singular form of the Estonian adjective 'väike', meaning 'small' or 'little'. It's used when referring to an unspecified amount of something small, or in contexts where the quantity isn't emphasized. In Estonian grammar, adjectives change their endings depending on case and number - here it's in the partitive case (which typically indicates incomplete action or indefinite quantity) and singular form."
