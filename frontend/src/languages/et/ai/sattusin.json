  "context": "The word 'sattusin' is the first-person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'sattuma', which means 'to end up', 'to happen to be', or 'to find oneself'. It describes arriving somewhere or finding oneself in a situation unintentionally, often by chance. The '-sin' suffix indicates that this is from the perspective of 'I' (minä) in the past tense."
