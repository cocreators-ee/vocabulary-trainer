  "context": "The Estonian word 'sain' is the first-person singular past indicative form of the verb 'saama', which means 'to get', 'to receive', or 'to achieve'. It indicates that the speaker has completed an action in the past. For example, 'Ma sain kirja' means 'I got a letter' (past tense), while 'Ma saan kirja' would mean 'I get a letter' (present tense). The word is conjugated for the first person singular ('I') and refers to actions completed by the speaker in the past."
