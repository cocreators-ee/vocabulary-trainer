  "context": "The Estonian word 'muide' is an adverb used to introduce additional information as a side note or afterthought. It functions similarly to English phrases like 'by the way,' 'incidentally,' or 'by the by.' The word signals that what follows is supplementary to the main topic being discussed - it's essentially saying 'I'm adding this piece of information as an aside' or 'speaking of which, I should mention this too.'"
