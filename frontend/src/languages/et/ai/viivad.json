  "context": "The word 'viivad' is the 3rd person plural form of the verb 'triikima', which means to iron or smooth. In Estonian, when adding '-d' to a verb stem, it creates the present tense conjugation for 3rd person plural (they). So 'viivad' means 'they iron/smooth/press'. The word can refer to physically ironing clothes, smoothing surfaces, or in chess terminology, forcing a draw."
