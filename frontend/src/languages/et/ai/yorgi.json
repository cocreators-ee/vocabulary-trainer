  "context": "Yorgi is an Estonian word that refers to a resident or native of New York City. It's derived from 'New York' and the Estonian suffix '-lane' which means '-er' or '-dweller'. The form 'yorgi' appears to be an adaptation of 'New York' into Eston phonetics, making it easier for Estonians to pronounce the English place name."
