  "context": "The Estonian word 'autos' is an inessive case form of 'auto', meaning 'car'. It indicates location within or means of transportation using a car, similar to saying 'in the car' or 'by car' in English. The '-s' ending shows it's in the inessive case, which answers questions like 'where?'."
