  "context": "The word 'saatana' is the Estonian word for Satan or the devil. It refers to the supreme evil spirit in Christian tradition, often personified as a figure of temptation and opposition to God. In modern usage, it can also be used as an interjection expressing frustration or anger similar to how English speakers might use 'damn it' or 'hell'. The word is borrowed from Finnish and ultimately from biblical sources."
