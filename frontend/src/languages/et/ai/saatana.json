  "context": "The Estonian word 'saatana' has two main meanings: 1) referring to the biblical Satan/devil as a supernatural evil being that tempts and corrupts humans, and 2) used as a curse word or interjection expressing strong negative emotions (like pain, frustration, anger), similar to English 'damn', 'hell', or 'Satan'. It can be used in various grammatical forms including as an independent exclamation, when addressing someone directly, or as a modifier before nouns."
