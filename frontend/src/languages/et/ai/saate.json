  "context": "The word 'saate' in Estonian can have multiple meanings depending on context. It is the plural form of 'saada' which means 'to send/deliver/give'. It can also be part of modal verb constructions where it indicates ability or possibility, similar to English 'can' or 'may'. The specific meaning depends on whether it's used as a finite verb form or in compound structures. When used in the plural imperative form, it would mean something like 'You all send/deliver/give'."
