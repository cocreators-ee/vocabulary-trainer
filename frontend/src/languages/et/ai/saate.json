  "context": "The word 'saate' is the second-person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'saama', which means 'to get, to obtain, to receive'. It appears in dictionary definitions as related to eskort escort, but this seems to be a different context. The primary meaning based on grammatical analysis and Wiktionary is that it's the plural 'you' form of 'saama' - used when addressing multiple people about what they are getting or receiving right now."
