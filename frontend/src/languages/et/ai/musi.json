  "context": "Musi is a colloquial Estonian word with multiple meanings depending on context. It can refer to: 1) A kiss - 'Plaksuga, matsuga, kerge musi' (With smacks and pecks, a light kiss); 2) A term of endearment like 'darling' or 'honey' - used affectionately toward loved ones; 3) Face, but this usage is childish. The word derives from 'musu' and has onomatopoeic origins cognate to Livonian 'mužīņ'. It's commonly used in compound words like 'põsemusi' (cheek kiss) and 'õhumusi' (air kiss)."
