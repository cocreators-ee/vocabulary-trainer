  "context": "The Estonian word 'hetkest' is an adverbial form derived from the noun 'hetk' (moment, instant). The '-est' suffix indicates the ablative case in Estonian, which typically shows separation or origin. Therefore, 'hetkest' means 'from this moment' or 'starting now'. It's used to indicate that something begins at the current point in time."
