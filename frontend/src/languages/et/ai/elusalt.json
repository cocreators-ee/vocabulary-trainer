  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'elusalt' means 'alive', 'living', or 'while still alive'. It is derived from the root word 'elus' (alive/living) and functions as an adverb to describe actions performed on someone or something that is still alive, rather than after death. The dictionary examples show its use in contexts like burying someone alive, swallowing them alive, putting skin on while living, catching prisoners alive, burning criminals alive, piglets being born alive, and crabs being put into boiling water alive."
