  "context": "The word 'ilusat' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian adjective 'iline', which means beautiful or lovely. In this context from a naturalism definition, it's used as an example of something that could be described naturally - both the beautiful and ugly aspects of life. The '-t' ending indicates the partitive case in Estonian grammar."
