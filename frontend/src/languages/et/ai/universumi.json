  "context": "The word 'universumi' is the genitive singular form of Estonian noun 'universum', which means 'universe'. In English, this would be equivalent to 'of the universe' or showing possession/relationship with the universe. The word appears in the context of anthropocentrism as a philosophical view where humans are considered the center and final purpose of the universe."
