  "context": "The Estonian word 'universumi' is the genitive case form of 'universum', meaning 'of the universe'. It's used to indicate possession or relationship with the universe, similar to how we might say 'the mysteries of the universe' in English. This word comes from Latin and is commonly used in scientific contexts as well as everyday discussions about space and existence."
