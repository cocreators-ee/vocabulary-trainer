  "context": "The word 'kukkusid' appears to be part of the compound verb form 'kukkusid hurjutama' in Estonian. The dictionary definition shows that 'hurjutama' means 1) to shame, scold, or reprimand someone, often by pointing out faults publicly, and 2) to drive away or chase off (used with animals). In the example sentences, we see it used in contexts where people are being shamed or animals are being driven away. The word 'kukkusid' likely modifies this action in some way, possibly indicating completion of the action, multiple actors, or a specific manner of hurjutama."
