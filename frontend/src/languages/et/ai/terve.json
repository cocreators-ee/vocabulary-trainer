  "context": "The word 'terve' in Estonian is an interjection used for greetings. It's similar to saying 'hello' or 'hi' in English. The word can be followed by the time of day (hommikust = morning, 천htu = evening, p채evast = daytime) to specify when you're greeting someone. While it literally means 'whole' or 'healthy', as a greeting it functions much like 'hello' does in English."
