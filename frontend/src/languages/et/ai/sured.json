  "context": "The Estonian word 'sured' describes a state of being angry or bitter, often stemming from a perceived injustice. It implies a deeper and more lasting anger than simply being mad; it suggests resentment and holding a grudge. In English, we might use words like 'resentful', 'bitter', or 'angry' to convey similar feelings."
