  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'üksinda' has two main meanings: 1) alone or by oneself (without others present), and 2) only, just (exclusively). It's formed from the word 'üksi' (alone) with the suffix '-nda'. In its first meaning, it describes being without company - someone doing something independently. In its second meaning, it indicates exclusivity or limitation to a single thing/person."
