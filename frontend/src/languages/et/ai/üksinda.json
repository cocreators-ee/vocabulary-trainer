  "context": "The Estonian word 'üksinda' is an adverb that means alone or by oneself. It emphasizes being in a solitary state without company, either physically alone or functioning independently of others. The word combines 'üksi-' (from 'üks' meaning one) with the suffix '-da' indicating manner or state. This construction clearly conveys the concept of singularity and independence."
