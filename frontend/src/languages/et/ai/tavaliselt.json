  "context": "The Estonian word 'tavaliselt' is an adverb that means 'usually', 'normally', or 'typically'. It comes from the adjective 'tavaline' (ordinary, common) with the adverbial suffix '-lt'. This word expresses what typically happens under normal circumstances or in most situations. For example, when saying 'Ta on tavaliselt rahulik mees' (He is usually a calm man), it indicates that while he may occasionally not be calm, his typical state is being calm."
