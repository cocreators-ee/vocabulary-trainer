  "context": "The word 'und' in Estonian is actually the partitive form of the noun 'tund', which means 'hour'. It's used to indicate a portion or amount of an hour. Additionally, 'und' can be a misspelling or mishearing of other words like 'tundub' (seems/appears) or could represent the end of 'tundes' (feeling/in a state of). The most common and literal meaning is as partitive form for time measurement."
