  "context": "The word 'tea' is a verb form in Estonian. It's the present indicative connegative of the verb 'teadma', meaning 'to know'. This means it's used with negative auxiliary verbs like 'ei' (not). It can also be the second-person singular imperative, giving a command or suggestion to know something. In the example sentences, we see 'Ei tea' meaning '(I) don't know', and 'Tea'p' which is part of a longer sentence structure where someone is questioning what someone else might have known about past events."
