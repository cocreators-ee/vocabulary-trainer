  "context": "The Estonian word 'kaasas' is an adverb that means 'with,' 'together with,' or 'along with.' It indicates that someone or something is present in the company of another person or thing. The word can also function as a postposition (following its object) and governs the comitative case. It's used to show accompaniment - being together with others, having something with you, or occurring alongside something else."
