  "context": "The word 'film' in Estonian means a movie or motion picture. It is borrowed directly from English and has the same meaning and spelling as the English word 'film'. In Estonian, it follows similar grammatical patterns where you can add endings to make different forms like filmis (in a film), filmid (films plural), etc."
