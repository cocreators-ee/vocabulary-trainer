  "context": "Kumbki is a determinative pronoun used in Estonian when referring to two separate entities, people or things. In affirmative sentences it means 'both' (nii üks kui teine - one as well as the other), while in negative constructions it means 'neither' (ei see ega teine - not this and not that). It can be used both adjectivally and substantively, with various case forms like kummagi (genitive/illative), kummaski (inessive), etc."
