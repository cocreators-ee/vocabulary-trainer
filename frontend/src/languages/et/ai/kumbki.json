  "context": "Kumbki is an Estonian pronoun that means 'either' or 'neither'. It's used to refer to one of two options when the specific choice isn't important or unknown. The word is typically used in negative contexts with verbs like 'ei' (not), indicating that neither option applies, or can be used more broadly for either of two alternatives."
