  "context": "The word 'käske' appears to be in the Estonian language. Based on the provided context and common Estonian vocabulary, this seems to be related to the word 'käsi' which means 'hand'. The '-e' ending suggests it could be an imperative form or part of a conjugated verb. However, without more specific context from actual usage examples, I'm providing analysis based on the most likely interpretation of this word in Estonian."
