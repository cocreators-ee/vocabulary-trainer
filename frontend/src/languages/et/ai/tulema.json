  "context": "The Estonian verb 'tulema' primarily means 'to come' and is one of the most frequently used verbs in the language. It has multiple meanings including: 1) to physically approach or arrive at a place; 2) to become (in terms of development, transformation); 3) to appear or emerge (visually or conceptually); 4) to happen or occur (for events or situations). The verb is irregular with the stem 'tull-' in past tense. It's used in various contexts like temporal expressions ('tulemas' - coming/arriving), obligation ('tuleb' - one must/have to), and as part of compound verbs."
