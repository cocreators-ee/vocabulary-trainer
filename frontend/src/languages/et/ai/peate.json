  "context": "The word 'peate' appears to be a variant or specific form of the Estonian conjunction 'aga', which primarily functions as a contrastive connector meaning 'but' or 'however'. In the given sentence \"Jajah, nojah, õige küll. Aga siis peate rikas inimene olema, kui nii palju raamatuid ostate.\", it seems to be used in combination with the verb 'pidama' (to have/need) as part of an expression meaning \"then you must be a rich person if you buy so many books.\" The word can also function adverbially to mean 'only', 'just', or 'merely'. It's commonly used for contrast between clauses, showing opposition or qualification of what was previously stated."
