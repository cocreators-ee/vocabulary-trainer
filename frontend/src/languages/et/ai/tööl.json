  "context": "The Estonian word 'tööl' is an inessive case form of the word 'töö', meaning 'work'. It indicates location or state, specifically being at work or working. The '-l' ending shows that it's in the inessive case, which answers the question 'where?' - so this would mean 'at work'. It can indicate both physical presence at a workplace and the state of being engaged in work activities."
