  "context": "The word 'tuleme' is the 1st person plural imperative form of the Estonian verb 'tulla', which means 'to come'. It's used to express a suggestion or invitation for a group (including the speaker) to move towards the speaker. This form would be appropriate when you're inviting people to join you in coming somewhere, as in saying 'Let us come' or 'We shall come'. In Estonian, this is a polite way to suggest movement toward your location."
