  "context": "Unenägu is an Estonian noun that refers to a dream or vision experienced during sleep. It can be used for both pleasant dreams and nightmares, as well as prophetic or significant dreams. The word combines 'une' (sleep) and 'nägu' (face/vision/apparition), literally meaning 'sleep-face' or 'vision of sleep'. In Estonian culture, unenägu is often believed to have symbolic meanings or even predictive power."
