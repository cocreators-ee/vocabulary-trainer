  "context": "The Estonian word 'hullumeelne' is an adjective that can mean several related concepts: 1) referring to a person who is mentally ill or insane (a lunatic), 2) describing wild, reckless, or irrational behavior or appearance, and 3) indicating something completely crazy, extreme, or beyond normal limits. It combines 'hullu' (crazy/insane) with '-meelne' which relates to the mind, suggesting a state of being where someone's mind is not rational or normal."
