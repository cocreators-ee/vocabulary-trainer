  "context": "The Estonian word 'ohver' is a noun that can refer to a sacrifice, offering, or victim depending on context. In religious contexts it typically means an animal or object offered in worship, but it can also mean someone who sacrifices themselves for others. The word has roots in ancient Baltic-Finnic sacrificial practices and carries connotations of giving something valuable up for a higher purpose."
