  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunneb' is the 3rd person singular present tense form of the verb 'tundma', which means 'to know' or 'to feel'. It can refer to intellectual knowledge ('knows'), recognition, or emotional feeling. In this context from the dictionary definition example, it's used in the phrase 'Aktiivne sõnavara: sõnavara, mida inimene tunneb ja ise kasutab', which translates to 'Active vocabulary: vocabulary that a person knows and uses themselves'. This shows how 'tunneb' functions as 'knows' when referring to knowledge or familiarity with language."
