  "context": "The word 'võtavad' is the 3rd person plural present form of the Estonian verb 'võtma'. It means 'take' or 'carry', but in this specific context from the dictionary definition, it's used idiomatically to describe how legs move when running very quickly. The phrase 'kuidas jalad võtavad/nagu/mis' appears to be an idiomatic expression meaning something like 'how the feet take/carry (someone) along' - essentially describing rapid movement or running as fast as one can."
