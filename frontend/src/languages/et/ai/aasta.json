  "context": "The Estonian word 'aasta' primarily means 'year' and has multiple related meanings: 1) a time period of approximately 12 months, either as a calendar/solar year (365-366 days), or any 12-month period starting at any moment; 2) age in years when used with numbers indicating someone's age. The word can also be part of compound nouns to denote specific types of years (like 'õppeaasta' for academic year). In its plural form and certain cases, it can mean 'for years' or indicate ongoing periods."
