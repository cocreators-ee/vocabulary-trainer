  "context": "Poleks is a contracted form of 'ei oleks' (Modern Estonian for 'would not be/would not have been'). It's the conditional mood negative form used in hypothetical situations. The word 'ep' is the old 3rd person singular form of the negative verb that has contracted with 'oleks'. This construction is commonly used to express what would NOT happen under certain conditions or to talk about past possibilities that didn't occur."
