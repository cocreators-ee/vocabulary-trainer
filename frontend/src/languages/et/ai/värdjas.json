  "context": "\"Värdjas\" is an Estonian word that means a female sheep or ewe. It refers specifically to the female of the species Ovis aries, commonly known as domestic sheep. In Estonian farming and agricultural contexts, this term would be used to distinguish female sheep from males (rams). The word follows Estonian grammatical patterns for nouns and can appear in different cases depending on its function in a sentence."
