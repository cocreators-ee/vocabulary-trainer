  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuus' is the cardinal number six. It can be used in various contexts: as a basic number (2×3=6), to tell time (at 6 o'clock), or as part of larger numbers (26, 6000). The word has different grammatical forms including genitive 'kuue', partitive 'kuut', and ordinal form 'kuues'. In card games, it can also refer to the number 6 symbol on cards."
