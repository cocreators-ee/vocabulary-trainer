  "context": "The word 'kunagi' is an Estonian adverb that means 'never' or 'ever', and can also refer to some unspecified time in the past. It's commonly used with negative constructions (like 'ei peaks') to express something should never be done, or with questions about experiences ('käänud'). When used affirmatively, it may refer to an unspecified time in the past. The word doesn't change form based on gender, number, or case."
