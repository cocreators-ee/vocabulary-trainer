  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'kunagi' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'ever' (in questions or negative statements), 'once' or 'sometime' in the past, or 'some day'/'one day' for future events. In affirmative sentences about the past, it indicates an unspecified time in history ('at some point'). When used with negation, it means 'never'. It can also be used in comparisons to emphasize something as being more extreme than ever before."
