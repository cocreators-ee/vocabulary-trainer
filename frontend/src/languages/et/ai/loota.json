  "context": "The Estonian word 'loota' is a verb that primarily means 'to hope' or 'to expect something with confidence'. It can also carry the meaning of trusting in someone or something. This verb is used when expressing positive expectations about future events, similar to how English uses 'hope'. The word forms change depending on the person and tense - for example, it becomes 'loodab' (he/she hopes) in third person singular present tense."
