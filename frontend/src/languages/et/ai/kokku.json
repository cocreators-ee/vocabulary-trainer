  "context": "The Estonian word 'kokku' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings. It primarily means 'together', 'in total', or 'altogether'. It can be used for: 1) expressing sums or totals (e.g., adding numbers), 2) indicating people or things coming together in one place, 3) describing physical contact or collision between objects/people, 4) indicating joining or combining parts into a whole, 5) marking agreement or consensus, and 6) forming expressions with verbs to emphasize incomplete or messy results. As the illative singular form of 'kogu' (all/whole), it carries this sense of completeness when used in certain constructions."
