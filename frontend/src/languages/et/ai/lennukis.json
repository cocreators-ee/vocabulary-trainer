  "context": "The word 'lennukis' is the inessive case (inessus) of the Estonian noun 'lennuk', which means 'airplane'. The '-s' ending indicates that something is inside or within something else. So 'lennukis' literally means 'in an airplane' and is used when someone wants to indicate location - being inside an aircraft during flight."
