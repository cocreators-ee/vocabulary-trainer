  "context": "The word 'millises' is an Estonian interrogative form that means 'in which' or 'at what'. It is used to ask about location, position, level, or state. As a grammatical case marker, it typically appears with the elative case (-s ending), indicating movement out of or away from something. In mathematics contexts, it might refer to asking about what power or level something is at (as in the square root example). The word follows the Estonian question word 'milline' (which/what kind) and takes its appropriate case form."
