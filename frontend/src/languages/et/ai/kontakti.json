  "context": "The word 'kontakti' in Estonian appears to be the adessive case form of 'kontakt', meaning 'contact'. However, based on the dictionary definitions provided which show extensive entries for 'kokku' (not 'kontakti'), it seems there may be some confusion. The dictionary primarily covers 'kokku' with multiple meanings: 1) in total/together as sum, 2) gathering people/things together, 3) physical contact/collision, 4) joining/combining into a whole, 5) becoming dirty/messy, 6) folding/compressing to take less space, 7) collapsing/failing, 8) reaching agreement, 9) being in harmony/agreement, and 10) as part of compound verbs indicating vague or messy results. Since the specific word analyzed is 'kontakti', it most likely refers to contact with someone/something, but could also be a misspelling of 'kokku' which has extensive definitions provided."
