  "context": "The word 'avatud' is the passive past participle form of the Estonian verb 'avama'. It primarily means 'open' as a state that has been achieved through opening something. In English, it can be translated to 'open', 'unlocked', or 'accessible'. This form is used to describe things that have been opened and remain in an open state, such as doors being opened (ust avatud), shops being opened for business (müük avatud), or windows being left open (avatud akna). The comparative form is 'avatum' meaning 'more open'."
