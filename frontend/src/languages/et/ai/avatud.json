  "context": "The Estonian word 'avatud' is the nominative singular form of an adjective meaning 'open'. It describes something that has been opened or is in an open state. In Estonian, adjectives change their endings based on case and number. The base form 'avatud' would typically be used to describe a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, but can also appear in other forms when declined for different cases or numbers."
