  "context": "The word 'pannakse' is the 3rd person plural present passive form of the Estonian verb panna (to put, to place). It indicates that an action is being done by someone unspecified or unknown, and focuses on the object receiving the action rather than who is performing it. This passive construction is commonly used in Estonian when the doer of the action is not important, unknown, or obvious from context."
