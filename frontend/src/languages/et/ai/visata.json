  "context": "The word 'visata' is the da-infinitive form of the verb 'viskama'. It means to throw something (specifically with a stone in these contexts) and indicates that something is very close or within throwing distance. The phrase 'kiviga visata' literally means 'to throw with a stone', but idiomatically it means something is nearby or close enough to reach by throwing a stone."
