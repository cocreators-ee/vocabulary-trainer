  "context": "Muljet is the partitive singular form of the Estonian word 'mulje', which means impression or effect. It refers to the impact or feeling that something creates on a person or audience. This word is commonly used when describing how something affects someone emotionally or cognitively, similar to how we might talk about making an impression in English."
