  "context": "Alatoon is an Estonian word that refers to a subtle, underlying quality or nuance in speech, writing, or artistic expression. It's the secondary or auxiliary tone that accompanies and often influences the main tone, suggesting additional feelings, moods, or attitudes beyond what is explicitly stated. The dictionary definition specifically mentions it as 'an addition, secondary/auxiliary tone that gives a hint of mood, feeling' and can be warm, caring, sad, elegiac, ironic, humorous, etc."
