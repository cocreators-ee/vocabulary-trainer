  "context": "The Estonian word 'väljaarvatud' is a past participle form meaning 'excluded' or 'left out'. It comes from the verb väljama (to leave, to exit) plus the particle arvata (to consider, to count). As a passive construction, it indicates that something has been left out or excluded from consideration. This word is commonly used in contexts where exceptions are being specified, such as 'all things except...' constructions."
