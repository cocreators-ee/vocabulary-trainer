  "context": "The word 'väljaarvatud' is an Estonian adjective that refers to something calculated or derived, particularly in scientific contexts. It's often used to describe climate systems that depend solely on solar radiation reaching Earth, making it related to both theoretical calculations and solar-based concepts. The word combines 'välja' (out/derived from) with 'arvatud' (calculated/thought out), suggesting something mathematically determined rather than empirically observed."
