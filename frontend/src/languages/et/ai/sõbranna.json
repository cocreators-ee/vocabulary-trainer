  "context": "The Estonian word 'sõbranna' is a noun that specifically refers to a female friend. It's derived from 'sõber' (friend) with the feminine suffix '-nna'. This term is used to distinguish female friends from male friends in Estonian. The word can be used for close, loyal female friendships and doesn't necessarily imply romantic relationship like 'girlfriend' might in English. Examples show it being used to describe former school friends or lifelong female companions."
