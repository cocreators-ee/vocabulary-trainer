  "context": "The word 'sõbranna' is a compound word in Estonian formed from 'sõber' (friend) and the feminine suffix '-anna', indicating it specifically refers to a female friend. It's commonly used to describe close friendships between women, similar to how 'buddy' or 'pal' might be used for male friends, but exclusively female. The term is platonic in nature and doesn't necessarily imply romantic relationships unless specified otherwise."
