  "context": "The Estonian word 'seest' is an adverb that indicates direction or position from the inside of something. It's used to express movement starting from within a space or location, similar to English expressions like 'from inside', 'from within', or 'from the interior'. In grammar, it often appears in contexts where someone is coming out of a building, room, container, or other enclosed space."
