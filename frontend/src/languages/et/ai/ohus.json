  "context": "'Ohus' is the inessive singular form of the Estonian word 'oht', which means 'danger'. When used as 'ohus', it indicates that something is in a state of being within or surrounded by danger. It describes a situation where someone's life, safety, or well-being is threatened or at risk. This form typically follows the noun it modifies and creates the meaning 'in danger' or 'at risk'. For example, 'elu ohus' literally means 'life in danger', indicating that someone's life is at stake."
