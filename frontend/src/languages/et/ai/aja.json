  "context": "The word 'aja' in Estonian is the genitive case form of the word 'aeg', which means 'time'. In this form, it typically translates to English as 'of time', 'during', or can indicate possession or relationship with time. It appears in phrases like 'aja jooksul' (in the course of time), 'sel ajal' (at that time), and is used to express concepts related to temporal relationships."
