  "context": "The word 'mehel' is the adessive case singular form of the Estonian noun 'mees', which means 'man'. In Estonian grammar, the adessive case typically indicates location on or near something. So 'mehel' translates to 'with the man' or 'on the man', indicating that someone or something is with or located on a male person."
