  "context": "The word 'mehel' is an Estonian adessive case form of the word 'mees', which means 'man'. The adessive case in Estonian typically indicates location near someone or something ('at/on/by/with'), but it's also used for indirect objects and other contexts. In this form, '-l' is the ending that marks the adessive case."
