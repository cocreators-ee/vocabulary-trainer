In this context, specifically 'palusid abi' would mean 'asked for help'. The word appears to be part of a phrase where someone was asking for assistance in some difficult situation. In the dictionary definition example, we see 'Haavatud oigasid ja palusid abi' which translates to 'The wounded cried out and asked for help.' This verb is commonly used when expressing need or request for aid from others."
