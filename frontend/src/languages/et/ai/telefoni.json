Specifically, it can be used as the genitive singular ('of the telephone'), partitive singular ('from the phone'), or illative singular ('to the phone') form depending on the grammatical context in which it appears. In Estonian grammar, nouns change their endings to indicate different cases and relationships between words in a sentence."
