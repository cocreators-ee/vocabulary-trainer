  "context": "The Estonian word 'järele' is a versatile postposition and adverb with multiple meanings. As a postposition, it indicates spatial relationships (behind/after someone or something), temporal relationships (later/following an event), purpose or interest in something (about/for), basis for action (according to/based on), or possession/appropriateness (belonging to/suitable for). As an adverb, it can mean following someone, catching up with someone/something, being left behind, remaining, imitating, checking up on, or towards the back. It's commonly used in various grammatical constructions and is essential for expressing spatial and temporal relationships as well as purpose or interest in Estonian."
