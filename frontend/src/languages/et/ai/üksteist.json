  "context": "The word 'üksteist' is the Estonian cardinal number for 11. It's an irregular numeral that comes from the Proto-Finnic expression meaning 'one of the second decade'. The word can be used in various contexts including counting, telling time (e.g., 'buss läheb üksteist kakskümmend' - the bus leaves at twenty past eleven), and indicating quantities or measurements. It has several alternative forms depending on grammatical case and context."
