  "context": "The Estonian word 'räägitakse' is the 3rd person plural present tense form of the verb 'rääkima' (to speak, to talk). It is commonly used in impersonal constructions where someone or something is mentioned as speaking. This form follows the passive voice pattern common in Estonian for expressing general statements about what people say or discuss."
