  "context": "The Estonian word 'külm' has multiple meanings depending on context. It primarily refers to cold temperatures (low temperature, little or no heat), especially when the weather is below 0°C. Figuratively, it can describe someone as reasonable/practical/considerate when referring to behavior, or unfeeling/indifferent/cold-hearted when describing personality traits. In terms of color/light, it refers to cool colors that evoke a sense of coldness (like blues). As a noun, it directly means 'cold' (low temperature, absence of warmth)."
