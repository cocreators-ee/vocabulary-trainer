  "context": "The Estonian word 'praeguseks' is an adverb that means 'for now', 'at present', or 'currently'. It indicates a temporary state or situation that exists at this moment but may change in the future. The word is formed from 'praegu' (now, currently) with the suffix '-seks', which transforms it into an adverbial form indicating a transitional or temporary condition."
