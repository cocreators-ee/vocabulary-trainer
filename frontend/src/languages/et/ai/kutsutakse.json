  "context": "The word 'kutsutakse' is the third-person singular and plural passive form of the Estonian verb 'kutsuda'. In English, it can mean 'is invited', 'are called', or 'will be invited/called'. This form is used when someone receives an invitation or is being summoned to something. For example, when saying 'Teda kutsutakse kontserdile' (He/She is invited to the concert), the subject (the person receiving the invitation) is in the third person and the action is passive - they are not doing the inviting but are being invited."
