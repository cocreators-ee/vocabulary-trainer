  "context": "The Estonian word 'petta' primarily means to fall in or collapse physically, but is also used figuratively to mean getting caught in some illicit activity or making a mistake in judgment. It can refer to physical objects falling inward (like ceilings collapsing) or people being discovered in wrongdoing. The word appears to be part of the phrasal verb 'sisse kukkuma' which means 'to fall in'. When used about people, it often implies failure in some endeavor or getting caught in misconduct."
