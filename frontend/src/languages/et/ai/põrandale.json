  "context": "The Estonian word 'põrandale' is a directional adverb that indicates movement or placement toward or onto the floor. It comes from 'põrand' (floor) with the '-le' suffix meaning 'to' or 'onto'. This term is commonly used in dance contexts to describe steps taken onto the floor without transferring body weight, as seen in folk dancing. The word emphasizes the destination being the floor surface."
