  "context": "The word 'teadnud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'teada', which means 'to know'. It functions similarly to English participles like 'known' and can be used as an adjective or in perfect tense constructions. In its masculine nominative singular form, it would be 'tunnevat', but 'teadnud' appears to be a past participle that can function both adjectivally and verbally. It often appears with the auxiliary verb 'on' (is/are) to form present perfect constructions like 'on teadnud' (has known/is aware)."
