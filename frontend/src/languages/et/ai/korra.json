  "context": "The Estonian word 'korra' is an adverb that means 'once', 'one time', or 'for a moment'. It can also be the genitive singular form of the noun 'kord' (time, occasion). In usage, it appears in expressions indicating a single occurrence or brief duration of an action. The dictionary shows it used in contexts like someone going to fish once, talking about something that happened one time, or visiting a shop briefly."
