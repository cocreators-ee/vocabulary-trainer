  "context": "The word 'imeilus' is an adjective in Estonian that means charming, adorable or cute. It's likely derived from 'imelik' (strange, odd) with a diminutive suffix '-lus', giving it the connotation of being delightfully strange or oddly endearing. The word describes something or someone that has an attractive quality that makes them particularly appealing or lovable in their uniqueness."
