  "context": "The word 'imeilus' is an adjective in Estonian that describes something as being unusually or extraordinarily beautiful. It's formed from the root 'ime-' (meaning wonder, miracle) and 'ilus' (beautiful). The '-ad' ending makes it plural form. This intensifier suggests a beauty that goes beyond ordinary, perhaps almost magical or exceptionally striking beauty."
