  "context": "In Estonian, 'ajada' is a versatile verb that primarily means to drive a vehicle or to herd animals. It can also mean to chase someone or something away. The conjugation changes based on the subject and tense - for example 'mina ajad' (I drive), 'sa ajad' (you drive), 'ta ajab' (he/she drives). When used with vehicles, it specifically means operating or controlling a car, bus, or other motor vehicle. With animals, it refers to guiding livestock from place to place."
