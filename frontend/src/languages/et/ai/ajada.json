  "context": "The Estonian word 'asjaajaja' refers to a person who is skilled at and enjoys managing tasks and affairs. It can mean an organizer in general terms, or specifically refer to an administrative officer or secretary who handles office work like correspondence registration and document organization. The term combines 'asi' (affairs/matters) with the suffix '-aja' (one who does), literally meaning 'one who manages affairs'. The plural form would be 'asjaajajad', indicating multiple people in this role."
