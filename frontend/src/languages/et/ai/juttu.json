  "context": "In Estonian, 'juttu' is the partitive singular form of the noun 'jutt', which means talk or conversation. It can be used to refer to a discussion, story, or conversation in general. The word often appears in phrases like 'ei saa juttugi olla' (not even possible to talk about something), indicating that something is completely out of the question."
