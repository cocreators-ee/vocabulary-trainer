  "context": "The word 'mitu' is an Estonian interrogative pronoun that means 'how many?' or 'several'. It's used in questions asking about quantity when the expected answer is more than one but not a specific large number. For example, 'Mitu inimest on kohal?' means 'How many people are present?'. The word can also be used declaratively to indicate an indefinite quantity of several items."
