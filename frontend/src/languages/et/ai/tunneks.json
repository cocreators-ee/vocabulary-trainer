  "context": "The word 'tunneks' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'tundma', which means 'to feel', 'to sense', or 'to experience'. In this case, it appears in a hypothetical situation - 'if we would not know/feel/sense'. The dictionary example shows it used in the negative conditional form (ei tunneks) where it means 'would not understand' or 'would not comprehend', but more literally 'would not feel/sense'. This suggests that in Estonian, understanding can sometimes be conceptualized as feeling or sensing something."
