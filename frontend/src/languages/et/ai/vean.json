  "context": "The word 'kera' in Estonian primarily means a ball or sphere, both as a geometric shape and as a round object. It can also refer to something being curled up or rolled into a ball shape. In the context of animals curling up (like hedgehogs or cats), it describes their spherical position when resting."
