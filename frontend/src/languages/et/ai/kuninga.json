  "context": "The word 'kuninga' is in the genitive case of 'kuningas' (king), meaning 'of the king' or 'belonging to the king'. In this form, it typically refers to subjects or vassals who are under the authority of a king. For example, 'Rootsi kuninga alamad' would mean 'subjects/vassals of the Swedish king'. It indicates possession or relationship - something that belongs to or is associated with the king."
