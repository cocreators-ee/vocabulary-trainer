  "context": "The word 'kuninga' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'kuningas', which means 'king'. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case indicates possession or relationship. So 'kuninga' specifically means 'of the king' or 'belonging to the king'. For example, 'kuninga kroon' would mean 'the king's crown'. The word shows how Estonian uses suffixes and grammatical cases to indicate relationships between nouns."
