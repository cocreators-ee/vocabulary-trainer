  "context": "The word 'jood' is an Estonian verb that means 'to drink'. It's the first-person singular form (I drink). The root verb is 'jooma', and 'jood' specifically refers to when 'I am drinking' or 'I drink'. In Estonian, verbs conjugate based on person and number, so this form would be used when speaking about oneself. Example: 'Jood vett igal päeval' means 'I drink water every day.'"
