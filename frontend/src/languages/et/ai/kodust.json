  "context": "The word 'kodust' is an Estonian term meaning 'from home' or 'out of home', but in this context it refers to house arrest/home confinement. It's used when someone is restricted to their residence and not allowed to leave, often as a legal penalty. The word comes from 'kodu' (home) with the '-st' suffix indicating movement away from the source."
