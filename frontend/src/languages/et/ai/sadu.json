  "context": "In Estonian, 'sadu' is the partitive plural form of the numeral word 'sada', which means 'hundred'. As a partitive plural, it indicates an unspecified or approximate quantity in the hundreds. It's used to express that there are many items, but not an exact count - essentially 'hundreds of something'. The word can refer to concrete objects (like books, people) or abstract concepts (questions, compliments). In the examples provided, we see it being used both literally for weather phenomena and figuratively for large quantities of various things."
