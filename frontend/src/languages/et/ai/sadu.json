  "context": "The word 'sadu' is the partitive form of 'sada' meaning 'hundred'. It's used when referring to an unspecified number of hundreds, or in contexts where you don't have a specific count. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is often used with quantities and numbers. For example: 'sadu aastaid' means 'hundreds of years', where 'sadu' indicates we're talking about many hundreds but not specifying exactly how many."
