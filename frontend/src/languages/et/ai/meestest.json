  "context": "The Estonian word 'meestest' is the elative case (third case) plural form of 'mees' (man/male). It indicates motion or origin from among a group of men, meaning 'from among the men/guys/males'. This case answers questions like 'kellest?' (from whom?) when referring to multiple males. The word shows Estonian's case system where the same root can take different suffixes to indicate grammatical relationships."
