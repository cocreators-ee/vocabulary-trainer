  "context": "The Estonian word 'sellest' is the elative case form of 'see' (this/that), meaning 'about this', 'from this', or 'of this'. It indicates movement away from something, origin, or topic. The '-st' ending in Estonian typically marks the elative case, which answers questions like 'where from?' or 'about what?'. In these examples, it's used to indicate the source of understanding (about this), the topic of discussion (about this theme), and the reference point for memory (from this incident)."
