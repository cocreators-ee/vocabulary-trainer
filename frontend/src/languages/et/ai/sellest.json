  "context": "The Estonian word 'sellest' is the elative singular form of the demonstrative pronoun 'see'. It functions as an adverbial case indicating origin, separation, or source - essentially meaning 'from this', 'about this', or 'of this'. The elative case in Estonian typically shows where something comes from or what it's about. In the example sentences provided, it demonstrates how 'sellest' can be used to indicate the source of discussion ('from/about this'), origin location ('from this house'), and focus of thought ('about these good things')."
