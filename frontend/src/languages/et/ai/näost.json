  "context": "The Estonian word 'näost' is a postposition meaning 'down from the face' or 'from the face downwards'. It's used to indicate movement or direction starting from the face area, typically describing something going down into one's mouth during eating or drinking. The first example sentence shows someone stuffing food and pushing it down from their face (into their mouth), while the second example suggests pouring liquid down from one's face."
