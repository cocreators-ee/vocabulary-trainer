  "context": "\"Viimased\" is the plural form of \"viimane\" (last/final) in Estonian. It can mean \"the last ones,\" \"the latest,\" or \"the most recent\" depending on context. The word appears to be used to refer to final lines or endings, as shown in the dictionary definition about telestihhon (which seems to be related to poetry where the last characters/words form a message)."
