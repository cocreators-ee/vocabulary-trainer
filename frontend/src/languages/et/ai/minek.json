  "context": "The Estonian word 'minek' is a noun that refers to the act of leaving, departing, or exiting from a place. It can be used in various contexts such as transportation schedules (when someone leaves), travel arrangements, or simply stating when someone is about to leave a location. The word comes from the verb 'minema' which means 'to go'. In Estonian grammar, it's formed by adding the '-k' suffix to the infinitive form of the verb."
