  "context": "The Estonian word 'varas' is a noun that refers to a person who steals or commits theft. It's the basic term for a thief in singular form, with the plural being 'vargad'. The word can be used to describe both petty thieves and more serious criminals. As shown in the dictionary examples, it appears in compound nouns specifying types of thieves (like car thief, horse thief, jewelry thief) and is commonly used in contexts describing thefts, stolen goods, or people who engage in stealing activities."
