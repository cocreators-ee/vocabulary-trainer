  "context": "The word 'kabinetti' is the inessive case (inessive) form of the Estonian noun 'kabinet', which means a private room or office. The '-i' ending indicates location within something, so 'kabinetti' specifically means 'in the cabinet/office'. This is commonly used for offices where people work, particularly professionals like doctors, lawyers, or managers."
