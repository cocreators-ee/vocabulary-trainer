  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'kursis' means being informed or aware of something. It's used when someone has good knowledge about a particular topic, situation, or development. The word often appears in contexts where information sharing or keeping someone updated is important, and it can be modified with intensifiers like 'täiesti' (completely) to emphasize the level of awareness."
