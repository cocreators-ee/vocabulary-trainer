  "context": "The Estonian word 'mängu' is the partitive case of the noun 'mäng', meaning 'game' or 'match'. It indicates an incomplete action or state - referring to some aspect of playing rather than a complete game. In the example sentences, it's used to refer to a starting time for a game, a future match, and describing what is considered the best/most interesting part of playing something."
