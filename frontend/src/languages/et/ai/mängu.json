  "context": "The Estonian word 'mängu' is the genitive singular form of the noun 'mäng', which means 'game'. It indicates possession or relationship to a game, similar to English possessive forms like 'of the game' or belonging to a game context. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case typically shows what something belongs to or originates from."
