  "context": "The Estonian word 'leiab' appears to be a typographical error or misrepresentation. Based on the dictionary definitions provided, it seems the intended word is actually 'ehk küll', which functions as a concessive conjunction meaning 'although', 'even though', or 'however'. This construction introduces a concessive clause that highlights an aspect despite which the main clause's situation or action still holds true. It appears in contexts where there might be obstacles, contrary opinions, or reservations, yet the main proposition remains valid."
