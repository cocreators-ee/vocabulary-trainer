  "context": "The Estonian word 'nelja' is the numeral four. It's used to count or indicate quantity of four items, people, or units. In Estonian, like other languages, numerals change form depending on case (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.) and function in sentences. 'Nelja' typically appears in contexts requiring specific grammatical cases after numbers."
