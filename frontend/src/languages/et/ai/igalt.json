  "context": "The word 'igalt' is an Estonian adverb derived from the root 'iga-' (every/all) and the '-lt' suffix indicating source/origin. It means 'from all sides,' 'from every direction,' or can intensify to mean 'completely' or 'thoroughly.' In the sentences, it describes something coming from multiple directions (fear coming from all sides, criticism from both sides, laughter from all around) or emphasizes completeness of an action."
