  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'igalt' means 'from all directions', 'from everywhere', or 'from all sides'. It indicates that something comes from multiple places simultaneously or covers an entire area. This word is formed from the root 'iga-' (all/every) with the adessive case ending '-lt', which in Estonian typically indicates location or origin."
