  "context": "The word 'laeval' is the adessive singular form of the Estonian noun 'laev', which means 'ship' or 'vessel'. The adessive case in Estonian typically indicates location on something or being on top of something. So 'laeval' specifically means 'on board (the ship)' or 'aboard (a vessel)'. It's used to indicate that someone or something is located physically on a ship or boat."
