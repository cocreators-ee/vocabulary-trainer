  "context": "The Estonian word 'laeval' is the adessive case form of the noun 'laev', which means 'ship' or 'boat'. In this form, it indicates location - specifically being on a ship/boat. The '-l' ending at the end of words in Estonian typically denotes location (on/at/in). This word would be used when talking about someone's location relative to a ship."
