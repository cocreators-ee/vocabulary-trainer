  "context": "The word 'kavatsete' is the plural second person (formal/polite) present tense form of the Estonian verb 'kavatseda', which means 'to plan' or 'to intend'. It literally translates as 'you plan/intend' and is used when addressing a group of people formally. In the example sentence from the dictionary, 'Kuulsin, et kavatsete puhkusele minna,' it means 'I heard that you (plural/formal) are planning to go on vacation.'"
