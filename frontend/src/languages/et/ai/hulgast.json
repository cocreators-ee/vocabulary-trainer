  "context": "The Estonian word 'hulgast' is an elative case form used to indicate movement or selection from within a group, collection, or crowd. It answers the question 'where from?' and shows someone/something being taken out, selected, or observed from a larger mass of people or things. This grammatical case expresses separation from a container or collective entity."
