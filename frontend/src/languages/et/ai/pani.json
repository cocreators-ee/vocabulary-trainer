  "context": "The word 'pani' is the third-person singular past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'panema', which means 'to put' or 'to place'. It indicates that someone (he/she/it) performed the action of putting something somewhere in the past. In the dictionary definition, it also appears as a title for married women in Poland and Czech Republic, but this is likely an unrelated entry given the context of Estonian language analysis."
