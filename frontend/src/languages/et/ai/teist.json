  "context": "The word 'teist' has multiple meanings in Estonian depending on context. As an adjective, it is the partitive singular form of 'teine', meaning either 'second' or 'other'. As a pronoun, it can also be the partitive singular of 'teine' meaning 'another'. Additionally, as a noun, it can function as the elative plural form of three different words: 'te' (you), giving meaning 'from you'; 'tee' (road/way), meaning 'from roads/ways'; and 'tee' (tea), meaning 'from tea'. The context determines which meaning is appropriate."
