  "context": "The word 'otsuse' is an Estonian noun meaning a judgement, decision, verdict, or sentence. It appears in the partitive case form (ending -e), which typically indicates an indefinite or partial object. The dictionary definition provided relates to 'autodafee' (auto-da-fé) and describes it as a solemn proclamation of a judgment and its execution, particularly the public burning of heretics or heretical books on a pyre. However, 'otsuse' itself more broadly refers to any formal decision or ruling."
