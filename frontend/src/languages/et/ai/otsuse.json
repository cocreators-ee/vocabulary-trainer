  "context": "The word 'otsuse' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'otsus', which means 'decision'. The partitive case is used in Estonian to indicate incomplete action, ongoing process, or when referring to something as a mass/quantity rather than a complete unit. In this form, it could be used with verbs like 'v천tma' (to take/make) or 'tegema' (to do), indicating the process of making decisions or the decision itself in various contexts."
