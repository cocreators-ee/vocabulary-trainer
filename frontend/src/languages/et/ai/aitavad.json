  "context": "'Aitavad' is the third-person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'aitama', which means 'to help' or 'to assist'. This form would be used when referring to multiple people (they) who are helping in the present tense. For example, 'Nad aitavad mind' means 'They help me'. The word comes from the same root as English words like 'aid' and shows how Estonian verbs have different forms for different subjects and tenses."
