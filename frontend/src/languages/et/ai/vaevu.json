  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaevu' is an adverb that indicates something was done with great effort or barely achieved. It suggests difficulty and struggle in completing an action or reaching a state. When used before a verb, it emphasizes the challenging nature of the task, while when used after, it often describes how little remained or how close one came to not succeeding."
