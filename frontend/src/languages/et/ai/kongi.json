  "context": "The word 'kongi' is the illative case form of 'kong', meaning 'prison' or 'dungeon'. In Estonian, when used with the verb 'heitma' (to throw), it indicates being thrown into prison or confinement. This usage appears in dictionary definition 2 where it says: 'Mees heideti vangitorni, - kongi, vanglasse, vangi.' meaning 'A man was thrown into a tower of imprisonment, - into prison, into jail, into captivity'. The illative case (-sse/-si ending) indicates movement or direction towards something, so 'kongi' specifically means 'into prison'."
