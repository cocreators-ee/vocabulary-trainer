  "context": "The word 'need' is a demonstrative pronoun in Estonian used to indicate or point out specific people, things, or ideas. It's the plural form that can mean both 'they', 'those', and 'these' depending on context. In first position it typically means 'these', while in second position it means 'those'. When used with verbs like 'teavad' (know), it functions as the subject pronoun 'they'."
