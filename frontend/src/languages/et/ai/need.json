  "context": "The Estonian word 'need' is a demonstrative pronoun meaning 'these' or 'those'. It's the plural form of 'see' (that/those) and refers to things that are near to or distant from both speaker and listener. The word declines regularly in Estonian grammar, with different forms for cases like nominative (need), genitive (nende), partitive (neid), etc."
