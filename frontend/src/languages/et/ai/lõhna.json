  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõhna' is the partitive form of 'lõhn', which means scent, smell, fragrance, or aroma. It's used when referring to an unspecified amount or some of the scent/smell. In English, we might say 'a nice scent', 'the smell of flowers', or 'a good aroma'. The word can be used for both pleasant and unpleasant smells, but often carries a neutral or positive connotation in everyday usage."
