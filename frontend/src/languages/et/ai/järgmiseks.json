  "context": "The Estonian word 'järgmiseks' is an adverb that means 'next' or 'following'. It's formed from the root word 'järgmine' (meaning next/following) with the '-ks' suffix indicating a state or purpose. This word is commonly used to indicate what comes after something in sequence, such as when asking someone to take their turn next, referring to the following item on an agenda, or transitioning to the next task in a series."
