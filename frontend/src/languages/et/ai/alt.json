  "context": "The Estonian word 'alt' is a versatile postposition that indicates location or movement from beneath something. It can mean 'from under', 'from below', or 'out from under'. As an adverb, it means 'from below' or 'downwards'. In phrases like 'hoia alt!' (keep back!), it serves as a warning to stay away."
