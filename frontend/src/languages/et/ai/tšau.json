  "context": "The word 'tšau' is an Estonian interjection used for saying goodbye. It's a borrowing from Italian 'ciao', which can mean both hello and goodbye depending on context, but in Estonian it's primarily used as a casual farewell greeting. The alternative form 'tsau' shows the variation without the č character (which represents /tʃ/ sound in Estonian)."
