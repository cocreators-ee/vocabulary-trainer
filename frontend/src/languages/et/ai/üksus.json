  "context": "The word 'üksus' in Estonian primarily means 'unit' or 'entity'. It can refer to a single item, group, or organizational component. The word derives from the numeral 'üks' which means 'one', so it carries the sense of singularity or individuality while also being used to denote organized groups as cohesive units."
