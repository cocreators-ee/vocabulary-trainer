  "context": "The word 'arva' in Estonian is the imperative form of the verb 'arvama', which means to guess, suppose, assume, or think. It's used when someone wants another person to make an assumption or provide a thought about something. In the example sentence 'Arva, mis ma leidsin' (Guess what I found), it's directly commanding someone to guess. The word also appears in expressions like 'Aga mitte ei oska arvata' (But I don't know how to guess) and is sometimes used with other verbs for emphasis, as in 'Tule aga lähemale!' (Come closer!)."
