  "context": "In Estonian, 'külg' is a noun that can refer to the side of an object or area. It's used when talking about lateral positions, edges, or borders. The word appears in different contexts - it could be the physical side of something like furniture (table), architectural elements (building), or geographical features (forest). In Estonian grammar, this word follows normal noun declension patterns but maintains its core meaning of 'side' across different cases and plural forms."
