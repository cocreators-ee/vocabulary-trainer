  "context": "The word 'isaga' is a Finnish-Estonian compound word meaning 'with father' or 'with dad'. It combines the Estonian word 'isa' (father) with the adessive case ending '-ga' which indicates accompaniment, similar to English 'with'. This construction shows how Estonian uses case endings to express relationships between people and actions."
