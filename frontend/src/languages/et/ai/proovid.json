  "context": "The word 'proovid' is the 3rd person singular present form of the Estonian verb 'proovima', which means 'to try' or 'to attempt'. It's used when someone is making an effort to do something, similar to English 'tries' or 'attempts'. The dictionary entry shows this as part of a larger text about various meanings of related words, but specifically identifies 'proovid' in context as meaning 'I try!' when someone says they will shoot accurately."
