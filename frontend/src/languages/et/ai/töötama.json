  "context": "The Estonian verb 'töötama' is highly versatile with several main meanings: 1) to do work or be engaged in labor, 2) to be employed somewhere and earn a living, 3) for institutions/organizations to exist or operate, 4) for body parts, thoughts or machines to function or operate properly, 5) colloquially to have an effect or influence. It can be used with both people (working at a job) and inanimate objects (machines working), as well as abstract concepts like thoughts functioning. The conjugation shows regular present tense forms like töötan (I work), töötab (he/she works), and töötavad (they work)."
