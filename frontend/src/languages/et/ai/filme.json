  "context": "\"Filme\" is the partitive form of the Estonian word \"film\" (movie/film). In Estonian, the partitive case is used when talking about an indefinite quantity or some instances of something. So \"filme\" means 'some films' or 'films' in a general sense, rather than specific, complete films. It's commonly used when you're referring to movies as a concept or category, rather than particular movies."
