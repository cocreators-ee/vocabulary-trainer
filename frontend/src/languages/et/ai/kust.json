  "context": "The Estonian word 'kust' is an interrogative and relative adverb meaning 'where...from' or 'from where'. It's used to ask about the origin, source, or place something comes from. The dictionary shows it has three main uses: 1) in direct questions asking about location, source, or reason (e.g., 'Kust sa tuled?' - Where do you come from?); 2) starting subordinate clauses indicating origin; and 3) in some expressions indicating an indefinite place someone/something starts from. It can also be used to emphasize a speaker's tone when starting sentences that actually contain negative opinions or judgments."
