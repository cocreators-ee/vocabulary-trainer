  "context": "The Estonian word 'hukka' is an adverb that can have multiple meanings depending on context. It generally means something ending up in ruin, destruction, or death. It can also mean something becoming degenerated, disordered, or ruined in a moral sense. In different contexts, it shows how things deteriorate to a negative state - whether physically destroyed, morally corrupted, or simply spoiled beyond use."
