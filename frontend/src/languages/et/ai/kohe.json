  "context": "The Estonian word 'kohe' is primarily used as an adverb meaning 'at once', 'immediately', or 'right away'. It can also mean 'soon' in some contexts. The word appears to be derived from 'koht' + '-e'. In usage, it indicates immediacy - either literal immediate action (like 'Go to the store at once!') or proximity ('The barn is right behind that tree'). Figuratively, it can express something happening soon ('I'll be there soon')."
