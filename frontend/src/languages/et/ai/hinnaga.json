  "context": "The word 'hinnaga' is in Estonian and means 'at the price', 'with the price', or 'for the price'. It's an adessive form of the noun 'hind', which means 'price'. The '-ga' suffix indicates accompaniment or instrumentality, so 'hinnaga' literally translates to 'with/at the price'. This construction is used when specifying the price at something is bought or sold. The dictionary entry mentions 'arbitraaži otsus' but this appears unrelated to our word as it's about a different concept (arbitration decision)."
