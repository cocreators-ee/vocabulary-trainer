  "context": "The Estonian word 'isiklik' means personal, private, or individual. It's an adjective that describes something related to a specific person rather than being general or public. The word comes from 'isik' which means 'person'. In Estonian adjectives need to agree in number and case with the noun they modify, so you might see forms like 'isikliku' (genitive singular) depending on context."
