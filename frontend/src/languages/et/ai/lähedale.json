  "context": "The Estonian word 'lähedale' is an adverb that means 'nearby' or 'close by'. It can be used in three main contexts: 1) to indicate short physical distance ('come closer'), 2) to refer to approaching time deadlines ('the deadline is approaching'), and 3) metaphorically for getting close to someone or something emotionally/intellectually. As an adverb, it typically follows the verb it modifies. The word can also function as a postposition (taking genitive case) meaning 'to/toward' with locations."
