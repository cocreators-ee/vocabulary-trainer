  "context": "The word 'ust' is the stem form of the adjective 'ustav' in Estonian, which means faithful or loyal. It appears to be a shortened or contracted form commonly used in certain contexts. The root relates to trust and faithfulness, similar to how 'trust' functions in English. In the examples shown, it's used in different forms - 'ustusin' (I believed/trusted), 'ustav' (faithful/adjective form), and 'ustavus' (faithfulness/abstract noun form)."
