  "context": "The word 'ust' is the partitive singular form of Estonian noun 'uks', which means 'door'. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is used for partial objects or indefinite quantities. It appears to be used as an interjection in some contexts similar to 'Hey!' or 'Hello!' when addressing someone. The dictionary shows examples where it's used to get someone's attention, like calling out to a child named Muri."
