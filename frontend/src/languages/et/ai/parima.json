  "context": "The word 'parima' is the elative case (third case) of the superlative adjective 'parim', meaning 'best'. In Estonian, the elative case indicates movement from within or out of something. So 'parima' can mean 'from the best', 'out of the best', or simply be used as the form needed after certain prepositions or in specific grammatical constructions. It's essentially the 'best' in its contextual case form."
