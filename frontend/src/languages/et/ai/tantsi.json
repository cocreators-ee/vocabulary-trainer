  "context": "The word 'tantsi' is the partitive form of the Estonian noun 'tantsumine', which means dance or dancing. It can also be the singular imperative form of the verb 'tantsima' (to dance). The form depends on context - as a noun it refers to an instance of dancing, and as a verb it's a command meaning 'dance!'."
