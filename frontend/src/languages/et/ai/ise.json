  "context": "The Estonian word 'ise' is a versatile adverb/pronoun that means 'oneself' or emphasizes the person, and also means 'by oneself/on one's own'. It can be used to show that someone did something without help (independently) or to emphasize that it was indeed that specific person who did something. It has different meanings: 1) spontaneously/naturally without external cause, 2) independently/without assistance, 3) separately/additionally, and 4) inherently/intrinsically."
