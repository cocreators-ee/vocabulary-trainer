  "context": "The Estonian word 'ise' is a reflexive pronoun that means 'oneself'. It's used when the subject and object of a sentence refer to the same person. For example, in 'Ta ise tegi selle' (He did it himself), 'ise' emphasizes that he performed the action personally without help from others. The word can also indicate doing something alone or independently."
