  "context": "The word 'ei' in Estonian is a negation particle used to form negative sentences. It corresponds to 'no' as an answer and functions as 'not' when placed before verbs or other words to negate them. It's one of the most fundamental particles in Estonian grammar, similar to 'ne' in Finnish."
