  "context": "The Estonian word 'ei' is a versatile negation particle that can function as both an interjection and an auxiliary verb. As an interjection, it means 'no' for direct answers or corrections. As an auxiliary verb, it's used to form negative sentences with verbs meaning 'not' - 'I don't know' would be 'Ma ei tea'. The word typically precedes the main verb in a sentence (except in some colloquial forms), and its usage is fundamental to Estonian grammar for negation."
