  "context": "The Estonian word 'veeta' is a verb that means to spend or pass time. It's commonly used when referring to how someone spends their free time, holidays, or leisure activities. The verb indicates the passage of time in a deliberate way - not just time passing by itself, but actively spending it on something. It can be translated to English as 'to spend' (time) or 'while away'."
