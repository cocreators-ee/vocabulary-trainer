  "context": "The word 'veeta' is used to describe plants that are amphibious - meaning they can grow both in water bodies and temporarily on wet or moist ground. These types of plants have adaptations that allow them to survive in aquatic environments but also tolerate periods when the water level drops and they're exposed to air or growing in damp soil."
