  "context": "The word 'saladuse' in Estonian is the genitive singular form of 'saladus', meaning 'of a secret' or 'belonging to a secret'. It's used when indicating possession or relationship with a secret, similar to how we might say 'the secret's' in English but typically translated more naturally as just 'secret' in context. This grammatical case is commonly used after verbs like 'leidma' (to find) to indicate what was found, or after nouns to show connection."
