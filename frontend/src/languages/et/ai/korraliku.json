  "context": "The word 'korraliku' is the elative case form of 'korralik', which means 'decent', 'proper', 'orderly', or 'neat'. In Estonian grammar, the elative case (-ku) typically indicates movement out from within something, but with adjectives like this it often functions as an intensifier or emphasizes a quality. The word describes someone or something that is well-behaved, tidy, proper, or meets appropriate standards of behavior or condition."
