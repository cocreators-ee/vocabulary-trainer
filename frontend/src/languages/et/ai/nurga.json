  "context": "The word 'nurga' is the genitive singular form of 'nurk', which means 'corner'. In this context, 'ümber nurga' is an idiom that means 'around the corner' or 'indirectly'. It refers to approaching something indirectly rather than directly, either physically going around a corner or dealing with something in an indirect manner. This phrase is commonly used in Estonian to indicate taking an indirect approach to something."
