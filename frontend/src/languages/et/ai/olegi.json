  "context": "The word 'ajur' in Estonian is a noun that refers to 1) draft animals or the driver/coachman who controls them, particularly for pulling wagons or carriages, and 2) metaphorically as a driving force or motivator behind actions. The dictionary examples show it used literally (camels bought as draft animals with their drivers) and figuratively (pride as the driving force of great deeds)."
