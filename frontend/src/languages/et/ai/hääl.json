  "context": "The Estonian word 'hääl' has multiple meanings depending on context. Primarily it refers to a person's voice when speaking or singing, but it can also mean the sound made by animals or objects, an opinion or expressed will in discussions, and a vote in elections or decision-making processes. It can refer to both human voices (described as loud, soft, clear, etc.) and sounds from nature or machines."
