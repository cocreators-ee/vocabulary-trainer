  "context": "The Estonian word 'taas' is an adverb that means 'again' or 'once more'. It indicates repetition of an action or event. The word comes from the Proto-Finnic word *taase, which has cognates in other Finnic languages like Finnish ('uudelleen', meaning 'again') and Karelian ('taas'). In Estonian grammar, 'taas' is used to emphasize that something is happening for a second or subsequent time. It's commonly placed before the main verb in a sentence. The word has been part of the Estonian language since at least the 19th century."
