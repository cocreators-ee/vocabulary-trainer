  "context": "The Estonian word 'preili' is a noun that has two main meanings: 1) An unmarried (young) woman or miss, often used as a form of address; 2) A lady, particularly referring to an upper-class woman. It's derived from the German word 'Fräulein'. The word can be used in compound nouns with various prefixes indicating different contexts (like kassapreili, kontoripreili). In its declension forms, it appears as 'preilid' in plural nominative case and 'preilit' in partitive singular."
