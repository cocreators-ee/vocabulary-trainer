  "context": "The Estonian word 'kohale' has two main functions. First, as a postposition (genitive case), it indicates upward movement or position - something moving toward or reaching above a point. Second, as an adverb, it means to arrive at a place or destination. In its first meaning, it's used when referring to physical movement upward (like clouds rising up over a city). In its second meaning, it's commonly used for arriving somewhere (like help arriving on time or a car reaching certain buildings)."
