  "context": "In Estonian, 'loom' primarily means animal or mammal. It can refer to animals in general (including humans from a biological perspective) but is often used specifically for mammals and domesticated farm animals. The word has both literal meanings referring to actual animals, as well as metaphorical uses when describing people with animal-like behavior characteristics."
