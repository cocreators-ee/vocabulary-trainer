  "context": "The Estonian word 'silmadega' is the inessive plural form of 'silmad' (eyes) combined with the '-ga' suffix. It means 'with eyes' and indicates that something is done using or through eyes/visually. This case formation shows possession or instrumentality - doing something 'with eyes'. The word structure follows Estonian grammar rules where words are inflected for case, number, and sometimes possessive markers."
