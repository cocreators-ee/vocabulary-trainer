  "context": "The Estonian word 'praktiliselt' is an adverb that means practically, almost, or virtually. It's used to indicate that something is close to reality, true, or complete, but not entirely so. This word modifies the degree of truthfulness or completeness of a statement, often implying that while there might be minor exceptions or limitations, the general case holds true."
