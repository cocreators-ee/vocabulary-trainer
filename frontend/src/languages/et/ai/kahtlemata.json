  "context": "The Estonian word 'kahtlemata' is an adverb that means 'undoubtedly' or 'without doubt'. It expresses certainty and conviction, similar to how we use 'undoubtedly' in English. The word can be used to emphasize the truthfulness or certainty of a statement. It's often placed at the beginning or end of a sentence for emphasis."
