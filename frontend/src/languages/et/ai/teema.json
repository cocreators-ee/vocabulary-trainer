  "context": "The Estonian word 'teema' primarily means theme, subject, or topic - something that serves as the main focus for discussion, writing, music composition, or analysis. It can refer to the central idea of a book, article, musical piece, speech, or conversation. The word comes from Latin 'thema' and Ancient Greek 'théma'. In Estonian grammar, it follows declension patterns with forms like teemad (nominative plural), teemat (partitive singular), teemasse (illative), etc."
