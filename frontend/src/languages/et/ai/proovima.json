  "context": "The Estonian verb 'proovima' has multiple related meanings. Its primary meaning is 'to try' or 'to attempt' when used with da-infinitive constructions (e.g., proovida tõlkida - to try to translate). It can also mean 'to test' or 'check' something's properties, suitability, or condition (e.g., checking if a door is locked, testing how a hat fits). Additionally, it's used for tasting food or drinks (e.g., trying apples from the garden). The word comes from 'proov' (test) + '-ma' (infinitive suffix), and follows Estonian conjugation patterns with various forms like proovin, proovid, proovib in present tense."
