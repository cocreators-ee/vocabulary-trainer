  "context": "The Estonian word 'saadik' is primarily used as a noun meaning an ambassador, envoy, or deputy - someone formally elected to represent others in government or diplomatic contexts. It refers to the highest diplomatic representative of one country in another country or international community. The word comes from 'saatma' (to send) + '-ik', indicating someone who has been sent on a mission. In broader terms, it can also mean any person chosen as a representative for others."
