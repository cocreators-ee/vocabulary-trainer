It means something that has been selected or chosen from a group because it possesses the best qualities or is considered most important. This adjective can describe people who are carefully picked for special tasks or positions, objects that have been chosen as superior examples, or works that represent the best selections of an author. The word carries connotations of careful consideration and quality."
