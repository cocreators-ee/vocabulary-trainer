  "context": "The word 'saaksin' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'saa-' meaning 'to get/obtain/receive'. It's formed by adding the '-ksin' suffix to the stem. In English, it corresponds to 'would get', 'could receive', or 'might obtain'. This form expresses a hypothetical situation - something that might happen but isn't certain."
