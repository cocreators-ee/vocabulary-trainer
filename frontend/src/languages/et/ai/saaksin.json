  "context": "The word 'saaksin' is the first-person singular present conditional form of the Estonian verb 'saama', which means 'to get' or 'to be able'. In this conditional form, it translates to English as 'I could', 'I would be able to', or 'I might'. It expresses a hypothetical ability or possibility in the present moment. The word is formed by adding the conditional suffix '-ksin' to the stem 'saak-' from the verb 'saama'."
