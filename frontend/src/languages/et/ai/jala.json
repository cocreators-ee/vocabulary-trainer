  "context": "The Estonian word 'jala' is primarily used as an adverb meaning 'on foot' or 'walking'. It indicates that movement occurs without using any transportation vehicle, by one's own physical power through walking. This word can appear in various contexts such as starting a journey on foot (astuma), going somewhere by walking (läks jala), or measuring distance walked (kümme kilomeetrit jala minna)."
