  "context": "The word 'dušši' is an Estonian verb form that means 'to take a shower' or 'to wash oneself under a shower'. It comes from the loanword 'dušš' (shower) and the '-i' ending indicates the infinitive form in this context. The dictionary definition shows it as related to 'kümblema' (to bathe), specifically referring to bathing/showering under running water rather than standing still water like in a bath. It's commonly used when talking about daily hygiene routines."
