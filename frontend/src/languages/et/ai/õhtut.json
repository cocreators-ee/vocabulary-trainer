  "context": "The word 'õhtut' appears to be a typo in the dictionary definition. It should likely be 'üle', which means 'over' or 'across'. In this context, it forms part of the compound verb 'üle anda', meaning 'to hand over', 'to transfer', or 'to deliver'. This phrase is used when giving something officially to someone else, such as handing documents, awards, responsibilities, or property from one person or organization to another."
