  "context": "The word 'õhtut' is an Estonian adessive case form of 'õhtu', which means 'evening'. The -t suffix in the adessive case indicates location or time, so 'õhtut' specifically means 'at evening' or 'in the evening'. It refers to a period of time during the evening hours. This is different from the nominative form 'õhtu' (evening) and would be used when talking about being located at or happening during the evening time."
