  "context": "The Estonian word 'hääli' is used in the context of starting or beginning something, particularly for musical instruments and engines/motors. It appears to be related to the concept of producing sound or getting into working condition. The phrase 'sisse lööma hääli' means to start playing an instrument, while 'võtma hääled sisse' refers to starting a motor or engine. This word is often used in idiomatic expressions involving instruments like accordions ('lõõts') and various mechanical engines."
