It indicates someone's desire, wish, or intention to do something or have something. The word can be used in various contexts: expressing personal desires (what someone wants), indicating necessity or requirement (something needs/wants to be done), showing inclination or tendency (things tending to happen), or even in negative constructions where something doesn't want to happen (referring to obstacles or difficulties)."
