  "context": "The word 'tast' is an Estonian adessive case form of the demonstrative pronoun 'see', meaning 'it'. It functions as a postposition indicating origin or source, similar to English prepositions like 'from', 'about', or 'of'. In grammar terms, it's used with nouns and pronouns to show where something comes from or what it relates to."
