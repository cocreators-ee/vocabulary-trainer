  "context": "The word 'kirja' in Estonian can have multiple meanings depending on context. It appears to be in the illative case of 'kiri', meaning 'into a letter'. However, it could also refer to 'linn' (city) in some contexts or be related to the verb 'kirjutama' (to write). The most common usage would be as the illative form of 'letter', indicating movement toward or into something related to letters."
