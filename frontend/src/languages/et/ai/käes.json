It can indicate ownership or possession (something being in someone's hands), availability (something obtained or accessible), temporal proximity (time being at hand), completion or achievement (having something under control), and current activity (something ongoing). The form shown appears to be the singular/neutral form, but it remains consistent across various contexts."
