  "context": "The word 'nuppu' in Estonian appears to be the partitive form of 'nupp', which can mean 'button' or 'deal/agreement'. In these contexts, it likely refers to making some kind of arrangement or agreement, possibly informal. The verb 'tegime' (we made) combined with 'nuppu' suggests the action of creating or establishing something like a deal or arrangement."
