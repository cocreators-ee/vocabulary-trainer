  "context": "The Estonian word 'loomulik' is an adjective that means natural or logical. It can be used to describe something that occurs in nature, follows a logical progression, or feels organic and spontaneous rather than forced. The word comes from 'loodus' (nature) + '-lik' (suffix meaning 'like' or 'having the quality of'). In different contexts it can mean natural, logical, organic, or even obvious/certain."
