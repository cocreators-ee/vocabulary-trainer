  "context": "The Estonian word 'tohiks' is the conditional mood form of the modal verb 'tõima', which means 'to ought/should'. It expresses what someone should or ought to do, often with a sense of obligation or suggestion. The conditional form indicates that this is not a firm requirement but rather a recommendation or possibility. In different contexts, it can translate to English as 'should', 'ought to', or 'might as well' depending on the nuance of the situation."
