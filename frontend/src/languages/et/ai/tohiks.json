  "context": "The word 'tohiks' appears to be a form of the Estonian word 'altkäe maks', which means bribe or payoff. This refers to money or other benefits given to an official in exchange for performing or not performing their official duties, often considered illegal corruption. The word is related to the concept of bribing officials to influence decisions that should be made impartially according to law."
