  "context": "The Estonian word 'elu' primarily means 'life' in English. It refers to the state of being alive, human existence, or the experience of living. As a feminine noun, it can appear in various cases depending on its function in a sentence - nominative form is 'elu', but it can take other endings like '-ga' (with life), '-de' (lives), etc., depending on grammatical context. It's a fundamental concept in Estonian language and culture."
