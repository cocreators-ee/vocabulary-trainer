  "context": "The Estonian word 'isiklikult' is an adverb that means personally or in person. It's derived from the noun 'isik' (person) with the suffix '-lik' (like, pertaining to) and the adverbial ending '-tlt'. This word emphasizes something being done by the individual themselves rather than through someone else, often used to express personal opinion or direct involvement."
