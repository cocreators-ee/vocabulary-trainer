  "context": "In Estonian, 'eluks' is an adessive case form derived from the word 'elu' (life). It functions as a postposition meaning 'for life', 'throughout life', or 'for the rest of one's life'. This form is commonly used in well wishes and expressions of goodwill, similar to English expressions like 'all the best for your life' or 'wishing you happiness throughout your life'."
