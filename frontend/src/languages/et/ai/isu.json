  "context": "In Estonian, 'isu' primarily means appetite or desire for food. It can also refer to a general craving, urge, or interest in something. The word is commonly used to express hunger or the desire to eat, as well as metaphorical desires for activities or experiences. The declension shows it's type 17/elu with no gradation - genitive and partitive forms remain 'isu', while plural nominative becomes 'isud'. Common compound words include 'söögiisu' (food appetite) and 'hundisu' (wolf-like appetite)."
