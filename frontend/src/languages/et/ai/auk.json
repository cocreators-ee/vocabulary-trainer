  "context": "The Estonian word 'auk' is a versatile noun that primarily means 'hole', but can also refer to cavities, pits, gaps, or openings in various contexts. It's used for physical holes in surfaces (like those in walls, floors, or objects), natural depressions (like craters or animal dens), and metaphorical gaps (like missing information or financial deficits). The word declines according to Estonian grammar rules with 'augu' as the genitive form and 'auku' as partitive."
