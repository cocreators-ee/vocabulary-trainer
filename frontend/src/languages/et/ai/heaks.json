  "context": "The Estonian word 'heaks' is the illative case (movement toward) form of 'hea', meaning 'good'. It's used to indicate something that becomes good or is made sufficient. In context, it often means 'good enough', 'sufficiently well', or 'acceptable'. This form shows movement toward a state of being good, so when you say 'tegin selle heaks' (I make this into good), it implies making something satisfactory or acceptable."
