  "context": "The Estonian word 'kavatsed' is the 2nd person plural form of the verb 'kavatseda', which means 'to plan/intend/expect'. It's used when addressing a group (you) about their future plans or intentions. The infinitive form 'kavatseda' would be translated as 'to plan' or 'to intend', while 'kavatsed' specifically means 'you (plural) plan/intend/expect'. This verb is commonly followed by another verb in the infinitive form to express what someone plans to do, such as 'minema' (to go), 'ehitama' (to build), or 'osaleda' (to participate)."
