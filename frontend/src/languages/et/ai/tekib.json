  "context": "The Estonian word 'tekib' is the 3rd person singular present form of the verb 'tulema' (to come) with a reflexive suffix. It means something that arises, emerges, or comes into being naturally over time. This word typically describes situations where new ideas, questions, problems, or opportunities develop organically without deliberate planning."
