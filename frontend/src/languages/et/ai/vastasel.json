  "context": "The Estonian word 'vastasel' is the elative case (from where/away from) form of 'vastas', which means 'opposite'. It's used to indicate position or location away from something that is opposite. The root 'vastas-' indicates opposition, and the '-el' ending is the elative case marker. This word typically appears in spatial expressions indicating direction or location relative to an opposite position."
