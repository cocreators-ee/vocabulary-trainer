  "context": "The Estonian word 'teda' is the partitive case form of the pronoun 'tema', which means 'he/she/it'. In English, it would translate to 'him/her/it (partitive case)' and typically appears in contexts where we talk about some aspect or partial reference to the person or thing. For example, in sentences like 'You watched him' (Temat teda vaatasid), the word 'teda' indicates that you were watching him/him as an object of action. The partitive case is commonly used with verbs indicating perception, desire, or other incomplete actions."
