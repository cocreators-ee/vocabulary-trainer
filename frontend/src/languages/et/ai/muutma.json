  "context": "The Estonian verb 'muutma' is a transitive verb meaning to change, alter, or transform something from one state to another. It can be used to describe changing physical objects (like a river's course), abstract concepts (opinions, beliefs), conditions (improving or worsening situations), and directions (a ship's course). The dictionary examples show usage in various contexts including making things different, better, worse, or back to how they were before."
