  "context": "The Estonian word 'endaga' is a reflexive form that indicates doing something by oneself or with oneself. It combines the reflexive pronoun 'enda' (oneself) with the adessive case ending '-ga' (meaning 'with'). This construction emphasizes that the action is performed without external assistance and highlights the self-referential nature of the activity."
