  "context": "The Estonian word 'heli' has multiple related meanings. Primarily it refers to sound - the vibrations that can be heard by the human ear or that travel as waves through an elastic medium. In a musical context, specifically refers to tones or notes produced by regular periodic vibration of a sound source at a certain pitch, as distinct from noise."
