  "context": "The Estonian word 'foto' is a loanword from English/International, meaning 'photo' or 'picture'. It's used in the same contexts as in English - referring to photographs taken with cameras. The word is neutral and commonly used in everyday language. In Estonian, it follows similar grammatical patterns as other nouns, though it may be more frequently used without declension changes compared to native Estonian words."
