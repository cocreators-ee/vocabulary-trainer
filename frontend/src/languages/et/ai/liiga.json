  "context": "The word 'liiga' in Estonian is an adverb that means 'too', 'excessively', or 'overly'. It's used to indicate that something exceeds a desirable limit, degree, or standard. For example, if something is 'liiga kallis' it means it's 'too expensive', and if someone runs 'liiga kiiresti' they run 'too quickly'. The word modifies adjectives and other adverbs to express excessiveness."
