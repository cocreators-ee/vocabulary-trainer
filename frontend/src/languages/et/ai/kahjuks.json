  "context": "The Estonian word 'kahjuks' is an adverb that expresses regret or sadness about a situation. It is used to introduce unfortunate news, missed opportunities, or disappointing outcomes. The word comes from the noun 'kahju' (damage/harm) but as 'kahjuks', it functions as an introductory adverb similar to English 'unfortunately' or 'alas'. When someone uses 'kahjuks', they are acknowledging that something didn't go as hoped or desired, and often expressing sympathy for the negative outcome."
