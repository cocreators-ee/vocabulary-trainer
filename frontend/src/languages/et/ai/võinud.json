  "context": "The Estonian word 'võinud' is the past participle form of the verb 'võima', which means 'to be able to' or 'can'. In this form, it indicates that someone had the ability, opportunity, or permission to do something in the past. It's often used with auxiliary verbs like 'olema' (to be) or 'pidama' (must/have to) to express past ability or possibility. The word can also imply successful completion of an action when used in contexts where someone managed to accomplish something they intended to do."
