  "context": "Võinud is the conditional/past tense form of the Estonian verb 'pidama'. It expresses obligation, necessity, or being forced to do something in the past. This word can appear in several contexts: 1) expressing what someone was required to do (had to/must), 2) indicating probability or likelihood of something happening, 3) expressing near misses or things that almost happened but didn't quite, and 4) appearing in reported speech where it indicates indirect information about someone's obligation. The word often carries a sense of constraint or external compulsion rather than voluntary action."
