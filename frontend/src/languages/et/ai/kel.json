  "context": "In spoken Estonian, 'kel' is the shortened form of 'kellel'. It's an interrogative pronoun used to ask about possession or belonging (whose) or to indicate direction towards someone/something (to whom/to which). The full form 'kellel' would be more standard in written language, but 'kel' is commonly used in casual speech."
