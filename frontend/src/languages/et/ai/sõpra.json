  "context": "The word 'sõpra' is the partitive form of the Estonian noun 'sõber', which means 'friend'. In Estonian, the partitive case is used to indicate partialness or indefiniteness. So 'sõpra' would translate to '(a) friend' or some friends, indicating that it's not specifying a particular friend but rather the concept of friendship in general or an unspecified number of friends."
