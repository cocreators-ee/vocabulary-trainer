  "context": "The word 'enamik' is an Estonian noun meaning 'most' or 'the majority of'. It's used to indicate that something applies to the largest portion of a group. The word is typically followed by the genitive case in Estonian, so you would say 'enamik [something]' - for example, 'enamik inimestest' means 'most of the people'. This construction indicates that whatever follows refers to the larger or more significant part of a whole group."
