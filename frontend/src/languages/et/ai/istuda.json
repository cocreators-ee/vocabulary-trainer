  "context": "The word 'istuda' in Estonian is the 3rd person singular form of the verb 'istuma', which means 'to sit'. It's used when someone is sitting or takes a seat. The dictionary definition shows it as part of the verb paradigm, and from the context sentences we can see how 'all' (meaning under/below) combines with verbs to indicate location or state."
