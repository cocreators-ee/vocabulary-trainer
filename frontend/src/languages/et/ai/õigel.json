  "context": "Õigel is an Estonian adjective derived from 'õige' (correct/right), with the '-l' suffix indicating location or position. It's used to describe someone who has good judgment, intelligence, or common sense. The phrase 'pea on õigel' literally means 'head is in the right place,' and it describes someone who is sensible, smart, and won't get into trouble because they think things through carefully."
