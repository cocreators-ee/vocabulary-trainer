  "context": "The Estonian word 'pimedas' is an adessive case form of 'pime', meaning 'dark'. It typically indicates location or state in darkness, describing where something happens or how someone is doing something. In these examples, it shows being physically in a dark place (a dark room), living without much light (in a dark apartment), and going to school despite poor visibility (in bad weather/low light)."
