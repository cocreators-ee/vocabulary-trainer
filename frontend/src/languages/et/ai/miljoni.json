  "context": "The word 'miljoni' is the partitive form of the Estonian noun 'miljon', which means 'million'. In Estonian, the partitive case is used to indicate an incomplete or indefinite quantity. So 'miljoni' typically means 'a million' or 'millions' depending on context - it could refer to a single unspecified million units or multiple millions. This form is commonly used when talking about amounts of money, time periods, or quantities that aren't specifically counted."
