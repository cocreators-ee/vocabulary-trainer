  "context": "The word 'pausi' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'pauz', which means 'pause' or 'break'. In this form, it typically follows verbs like 'võtma' (to take) or appears in contexts where a pause or break is mentioned. The partitive case often indicates an incomplete action or object that exists but isn't fully specified."
