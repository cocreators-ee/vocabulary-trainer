  "context": "The word 'pausi' is the genitive singular, partitive singular, and illative singular form of Estonian noun 'paus'. It can refer to a pause or break in general, but specifically in slang usage it means skipping school without a valid reason. In the example sentences, it shows boys deciding to take a break from boring class and someone simply taking time off from school."
