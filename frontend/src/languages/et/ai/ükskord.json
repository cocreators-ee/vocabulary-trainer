  "context": "The Estonian word 'ükskord' is an adverb that means 'once' or 'one time'. It indicates a single occurrence in the past or at some unspecified time. The word comes from 'üks' (one) + 'kord' (time), literally meaning 'one time'. It's commonly used to describe something that happened on a previous occasion but is not happening now, or to express the possibility of something happening again in the future."
