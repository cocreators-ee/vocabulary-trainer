  "context": "The Estonian word 'ükskord' is an adverb with multiple meanings. It can mean 'once' referring to an unspecified time in the past or future, similar to English 'one day' or 'sometime.' It also means 'sometimes' when used as an equivalent of 'mõnikord.' Additionally, it can express 'finally' or 'eventually' when emphasizing that something should happen after a period of waiting. The word combines 'üks' (one) with 'kord' (time/occasion), literally meaning 'one time' but expanding to these various temporal expressions."
