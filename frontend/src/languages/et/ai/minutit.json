  "context": "The word 'minutit' is the partitive case of the Estonian word 'minut', which means 'minute'. In Estonian, nouns change their form depending on grammatical case and number. The partitive case (ending -t) is often used to indicate a portion or quantity of something, or in certain time expressions. Here it's used as a direct object following numbers indicating duration."
