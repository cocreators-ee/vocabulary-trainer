  "context": "The Estonian word 'minutit' is the partitive case form of the noun 'minut', which means 'minute'. The partitive case is commonly used with units of time, especially when referring to an unspecified or indefinite duration. It's similar to saying 'some minutes' or just 'minutes' in English without specifying an exact number."
