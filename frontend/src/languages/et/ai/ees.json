  "context": "The Estonian word 'ees' is a versatile word that primarily means 'before', 'in front of', or 'ahead'. It can function as both an adverb and a postposition. As an adverb, it indicates position in space (being ahead of someone/something), time (something coming up), or status (being ahead in development). As a postposition, it follows nouns to indicate location relative to something ('before' or 'in front of'). The word has numerous contextual uses including spatial relationships, temporal sequences, court proceedings, social comparisons, and can also appear in various idiomatic expressions."
