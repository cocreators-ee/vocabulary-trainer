  "context": "The Estonian word 'ees' is an adverb and preposition that means 'in front of', 'before', or 'forward'. It indicates position relative to the front or anterior part. In its basic form, it's used to describe something being positioned ahead of someone or something else. For example, when saying 'Tule eemale' (Come forward), you're indicating movement toward a more frontal position."
