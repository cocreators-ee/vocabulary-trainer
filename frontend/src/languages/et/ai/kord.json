  "context": "The Estonian word 'kord' has multiple meanings depending on context. As an adverb, it can mean 'once', 'one time', or 'someday' when referring to past or future events. When used emphatically, it means 'at last' or 'finally'. It's also a noun meaning 'time' or 'occasion', and as a compound word component in words like 'ükskord' (once) and 'teinekord' (sometimes). The dictionary shows its declension forms including nominative kord, genitive korra, partitive korda, etc. In conversational Estonian it can also mean 'for a moment' or briefly."
