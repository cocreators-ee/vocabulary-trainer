  "context": "The word 'abielluda' appears to be related to marriage proposals. Based on the dictionary definition provided, it shows that when used in combination with 'ettepaneku' (proposal), it forms 'abieluettepanek' or 'abiellumisettepanek', both meaning 'marriage proposal'. The root word seems to derive from 'abielu' (marriage) and indicates the action of proposing marriage. Example sentences show usage in contexts of making proposals, asking if someone is ready to marry, and the act of proposing itself."
