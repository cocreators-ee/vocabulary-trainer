  "context": "The Estonian word 'armastus' primarily means love in the broad sense - it can refer to deep affection for someone or something, romantic love, or even sexual intimacy. It's derived from the verb 'armastama' (to love). The word has a rich semantic range including familial love, passion for activities/work, and sometimes colloquially refers to the person being loved. Estonian uses this single term where English might distinguish between different types of love."
