  "context": "The word 'otsustanud' is the past participle of the Estonian verb 'otsustama', which means to decide. It indicates that someone has made a decision in the past and often implies completion of the decision-making process. In grammatical terms, it's formed with the suffix '-tud/-nud' which creates perfective aspect verbs in Estonian."
