  "context": "The word 'teevad' is the third-person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'tegema', which means 'to make' or 'to do'. It can translate to English as 'they do' or 'they make' when referring to a third person (he/she/they), and also as 'you do' or 'you make' in formal address. The word follows the conjugation pattern where -ma verbs form their present tense by dropping the final -a and adding appropriate endings. In this case, -vad is added for third-person plural subjects."
