  "context": "The Estonian word 'sugulane' means relative or cousin, referring to someone who shares a common ancestor with another person. It can refer to close relatives like parents, siblings, but also more distant relations. The term encompasses both blood relatives and through marriage connections, and has specific forms for different degrees of relationship (like lähedane sugulane - close relative). In a broader sense, it can metaphorically describe similar things or people with shared characteristics."
