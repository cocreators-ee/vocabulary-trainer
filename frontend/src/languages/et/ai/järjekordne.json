  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'järjekordne' has two main meanings: 1) referring to something that is next in sequence or the immediate following one (like 'the next concern' after finding work), and 2) describing something that occurs periodically, regularly, or repeatedly among similar phenomena (like regular meetings, performances, or attempts). It can modify nouns to indicate their position in a series or frequency of occurrence."
