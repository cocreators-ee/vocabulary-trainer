  "context": "The Estonian word 'juba' is a versatile adverb with several related meanings. Primarily it indicates that something has already begun or ended, implying it wasn't the case before (e.g., 'I'm already on my way'). It can also emphasize that a situation has been going on for some time (e.g., 'We've been living together for years') and is used in imperatives to express urgency. Additionally, it functions as an emphatic particle meaning 'just', 'even', or 'simply' depending on context. Its usage often corresponds to English adverbs like 'already', 'now', or 'still'."
