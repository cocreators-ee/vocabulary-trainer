  "context": "The Estonian word 'pakkumise' is the genitive singular form of 'pakkumine', which means 'offer' or 'proposal'. It indicates something that is being offered to someone, often in a business context like a job offer, business proposal, or bid. The '-ise' ending shows possession or relation - so it literally means 'of an offer' or 'related to an offer'. This form is commonly used when you want to express what belongs to or is associated with the offer."
