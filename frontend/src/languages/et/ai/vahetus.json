  "context": "The Estonian word 'vahetus' has multiple related meanings. It primarily refers to the act of exchanging or replacing something (like swapping items), but it can also mean a period of work shifts, a change in government or power, or even sincerity/directness in its second etymology. The form changes depending on case and number - for example 'vahetus' is singular nominative, while 'vahetused' would be plural nominative."
