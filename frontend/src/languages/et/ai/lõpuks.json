  "context": "The word 'lõpuks' is an Estonian adverb that means 'finally', 'at last', or 'in the end'. It indicates that something has happened after a period of waiting, delay, or expectation. The word comes from the root 'lõpp' which means 'end', and the suffix '-uks' which makes it an adverb expressing time or manner. It's commonly used to mark the completion of a process or the resolution of a situation that was anticipated."
