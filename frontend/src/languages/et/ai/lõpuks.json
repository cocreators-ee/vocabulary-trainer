  "context": "The word 'lõpuks' is an adverb in Estonian that indicates something happened at the conclusion of a sequence or after some delay. It can mean 'finally', 'after all', or 'in the end'. The word comes from 'lõpp' (end) with the adessive case suffix '-ks', suggesting movement toward or arrival at an ending point. It's commonly used to mark that something has been completed after a process, delay, or resistance."
