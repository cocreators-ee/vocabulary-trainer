  "context": "The Estonian word 'üpris' is an adverb used to express a moderate degree or extent of something. It's similar in meaning to English words like 'quite', 'rather', or 'pretty'. This adverb is commonly used before adjectives or other adverbs to soften their intensity. For example, 'üpris hea' means 'quite good', and 'üpis keeruline' means 'rather difficult'. The word doesn't have a direct equivalent in English but functions similarly to these moderate intensifiers."
