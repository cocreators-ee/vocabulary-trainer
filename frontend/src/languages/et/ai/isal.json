  "context": "The word 'isal' in Estonian means 'father' or 'dad'. It's the translative case of the word 'isa', which means father. The translative case in Estonian indicates a change of state or identity - it shows what something becomes or is transformed into. In this case, 'isal' would be used when someone or something is referred to as being 'in the role of' a father or 'as a father'."
