  "context": "The Estonian word 'öösel' is an adverb that means 'at night' or 'during the night'. It is formed from the root word 'öö' (night) with the suffix '-sel', which in Estonian can indicate a location, time, or manner. In this case, it specifically indicates the temporal sense of when something happens - during nighttime hours."
