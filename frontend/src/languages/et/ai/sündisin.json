  "context": "The word 'sündisin' is the first person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'sünnima', which means 'to be born'. It is formed by adding the personal ending '-n' to the stem 'sündis-', which comes from the noun 'sündmus' (event) related to birth. In Estonian, this verb is used specifically for expressing that someone was born at a particular time or place."
