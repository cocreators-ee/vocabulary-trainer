  "context": "The word 'türapea' in Estonian is a term of endearment used to refer to someone you care about romantically or affectionately. It's similar to English terms like 'sweetheart', 'darling', or 'dear'. The word combines 'tütar' (daughter/girl) and pea (head), literally meaning 'girl head' but functioning as an affectionate term for a young woman or girlfriend."
