  "context": "Türapea is a vulgar Estonian curse word that combines 'türa' (related to the English swear word) and 'pea' (head), literally meaning something like 'damn head'. It's used as an insult to call someone stupid or foolish. The word is considered very offensive and vulgar, similar to how 'dumbass' or 'idiot' would be used in English but with stronger profanity due to the 'türa' component."
