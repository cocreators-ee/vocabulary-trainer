  "context": "The word 'arvanud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'arvama', which means 'to believe' or 'to think'. In the provided example sentence, it's used in the context where someone's mother thought or believed that something would go wrong (literally 'go behind the garden'). The word appears to be connected to the idiom 'aia taha minema' which means to fail or come to nothing."
