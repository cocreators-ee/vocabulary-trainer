  "context": "The Estonian verb 'kasutama' means 'to use'. It's a versatile word that can be applied to various contexts - physical objects, tools, methods, opportunities, people (in the sense of employing), time, money, and even abstractions. The word is derived from 'kasu' meaning benefit or advantage plus the '-tama' suffix which forms verbs. In modern Estonian, it's more commonly used than its synonym 'tarvitama'. It can be used in different conjugations depending on tense, person, and voice."
