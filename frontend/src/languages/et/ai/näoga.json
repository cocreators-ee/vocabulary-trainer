  "context": "The Estonian word 'näoga' is an adverbial form that means 'with the face' or 'in person'. It indicates physical presence rather than virtual, telephone, or other remote communication. The word comes from 'nägü' (face) with the '-ga' suffix meaning 'with', so literally it means 'with one's face'. It's used to emphasize that someone is physically present somewhere rather than communicating remotely."
