  "context": "The word 'meeldid' is the singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'meelda', which means to be pleasing or liked. It appears in contexts where someone expresses appreciation for qualities, actions, or characteristics. In the example sentences provided from the dictionary definitions, it shows how people appreciate others' work ethic ('oma töökuse pärast'), skills ('saamatuse pärast' - perhaps ironically meaning despite lack of skill), and feel pride on behalf of others ('sinu pärast uhke'). The word is part of the verb 'meelda' (to please, to be liked) and its conjugation form in past tense."
