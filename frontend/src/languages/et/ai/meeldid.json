  "context": "The Estonian word 'meeldid' appears to be a verb form that expresses liking or enjoyment. It is likely related to the root verb 'meelda' which means 'to like' or 'to please'. In different forms, it can express whether someone likes something (present tense) or liked something (past tense). For example: 'meeldib' (3rd person singular present - he/she/it likes), 'meeldiv' (negative form - doesn't like), and 'meeldis' (past tense - liked)."
