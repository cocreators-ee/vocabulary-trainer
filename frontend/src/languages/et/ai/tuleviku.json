  "context": "The word 'tuleviku' is an Estonian genitive singular form of the noun 'tulevik', which means 'future'. It refers to the time period that will come after the present, and when combined with other words like 'plaanid' (plans), it indicates plans or arrangements made for what lies ahead. The genitive case shows possession or relationship - in this case, plans belonging to or concerning the future."
