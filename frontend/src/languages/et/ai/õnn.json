  "context": "The Estonian word 'õnn' is a versatile term that primarily means both 'happiness' and 'luck'. It can refer to personal happiness, joy about one's life situation (definition 1), but also to good fortune or favorable circumstances beyond one's control (definition 2). As shown in its declension patterns, 'õnn' follows the ÕS type 22i/külm with length gradation. The word is commonly used in well-wishes ('palju õnne sünnipäevaks'), expressions of gratitude ('õnn, et terve nahaga pääsesin'), and can be modified by various prefixes to form compound words like 'perekonnaõnn' (family happiness) or 'ebaõnn' (misfortune)."
