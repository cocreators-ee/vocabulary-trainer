  "context": "'Ajame' is the first person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'aja', which means 'to drive'. It specifically refers to the action of driving from the perspective of the speaker and others included in 'we' (the speaker and at least one other person). In English, this would be translated as 'we drive' or 'we are driving' depending on context. The word is formed by taking the root verb 'aja', adding the first person plural suffix '-me', which indicates the subject includes the speaker."
