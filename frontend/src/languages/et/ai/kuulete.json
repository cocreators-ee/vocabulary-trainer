  "context": "The word 'kuulete' is the 2nd person plural formal present tense form of the Estonian verb 'kulgma', which means to hear or listen. It's used when addressing multiple people formally, similar to 'you all' in English but with the added nuance of respect or formality. The '-te' ending indicates it's the formal/plural form, and the base word comes from 'kuul-', meaning ear/hear."
