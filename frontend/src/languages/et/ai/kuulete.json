  "context": "The word 'kuulete' appears to be part of a quotation where someone is shouting or barking aggressively. In Estonian, 'klähvima' means to bark, snarl, or shout in an aggressive manner. The example shows Kapral shouting/barking at the police officer in anger after being called names. This word is used when describing loud, harsh vocalizations made by animals like dogs and wolves, but also metaphorically for human shouting."
