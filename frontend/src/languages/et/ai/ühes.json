In Estonian, this word typically appears with the preposition \"ühes\" meaning \"in one\" or \"in a single\" when referring to location within singular nouns, or it can mean \"together\" when used without a specific prepositional context. It is commonly used in expressions indicating something happening in one place among multiple options, or involving people doing something together."
