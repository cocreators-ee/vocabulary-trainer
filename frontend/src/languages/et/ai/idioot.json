  "context": "In Estonian, 'idioot' is used to describe someone with very low intelligence, specifically referring to a mentally deficient person whose intellectual level doesn't exceed that of a several-year-old child. It's also commonly used as a curse word to mean extremely stupid or foolish. The word appears in strong expressions of frustration when someone does something remarkably unwise."
