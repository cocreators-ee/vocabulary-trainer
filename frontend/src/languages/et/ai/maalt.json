  "context": "Maalt is the ablative singular form of the Estonian word 'maa', meaning 'land' or 'country'. In historical context, it specifically refers to taxes collected from peasants during feudal times. The ablative case indicates movement away from something, so 'maalt' literally means 'from the land' and was used to denote collection of taxes (fees/money) from rural areas and peasant populations."
