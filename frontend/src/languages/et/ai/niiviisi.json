  "context": "The Estonian word 'niiviisi' is an adverb that means 'in this way', 'thus', or 'so'. It's used to indicate a manner or method of doing something, similar to how we use expressions like 'this way' or 'like this' in English. The word doesn't change form for different grammatical contexts and functions as an intensifier or demonstrative adverb."
