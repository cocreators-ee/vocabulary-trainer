  "context": "The word 'mõnda' is an Estonian adverbial form related to temporary duration, meaning 'for some time', 'for a while', or 'temporarily'. It's derived from the adjective 'ajutine' (temporary) and indicates something that lasts for an unspecified but limited period of time. This form is commonly used with temporal expressions to describe actions or states that are not permanent."
