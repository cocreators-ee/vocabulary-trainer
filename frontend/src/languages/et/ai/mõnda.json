  "context": "In Estonian, 'mõnda' is an adverb that indicates a small or moderate amount of something. It can be translated as 'some', 'a little', 'a bit', or 'somewhat'. This word modifies the degree or extent of an adjective or verb, indicating that something exists to a limited but not insignificant degree. For example, in 'mõnda aega' (for some time), it indicates a period of time that is more than just very brief but not necessarily long."
