  "context": "The word 'tegude' appears to be a genitive form related to the verb 'astuma välja' (to step out). In this context, it likely means '(of) deeds' or '(of) actions', suggesting coming out with one's actions or stepping forward through one's deeds. The dictionary shows that 'astuma välja' can mean to step out physically, to resign from an organization, or to come out in defense of something/someone. When combined with 'tegude' (deeds/actions), it suggests taking action through one's deeds."
