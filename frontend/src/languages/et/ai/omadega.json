  "context": "The word 'omadega' is the inessive case (with/inside) plural form of the Estonian pronoun 'oma', which means 'one's own'. It indicates having or being accompanied by one's own things, people, or characteristics. The '-ga' suffix adds the meaning of 'with', and since it's plural, it refers to multiple items or people that belong to someone."
