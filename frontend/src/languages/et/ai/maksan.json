  "context": "The Estonian word 'maksan' is the first person singular present tense form of the verb 'maksama', which means 'to pay'. It's used when referring to oneself paying for something or making a payment. The word appears to be in error in the provided dictionary definitions (ekss), as those definitions are actually for the word 'jätma' meaning 'to leave' or 'to abandon'. Based on context and common Estonian vocabulary, 'maksan' clearly means 'I pay' rather than anything related to leaving things behind."
