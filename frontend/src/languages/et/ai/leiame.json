  "context": "Leiame is the 1st person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'leidma', which means 'to find' or 'to discover'. It translates to English as 'we find' or 'we discover'. The word follows the conjugation pattern for -ma verbs in Estonian, where the stem 'leid-' is formed by dropping the final '-a' from the infinitive form."
