  "context": "The Estonian word 'lähedal' is an adverb and postposition that means 'nearby', 'close', or 'nearly'. It can indicate physical proximity in space (living close to someone/something), temporal proximity (something about to happen), or metaphorical closeness (being near to the truth or having a close relationship). When used as a postposition, it follows nouns in the genitive case. Examples include describing where someone lives, when an event is happening, or how closely something approaches a particular value or state."
