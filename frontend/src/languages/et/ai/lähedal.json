  "context": "The Estonian word 'lähedal' is an adverb meaning 'near', 'close to', or 'by'. It describes the proximity of something in relation to another location. The word comes from 'lähine' (near) and the '-al' suffix indicating position or state, so it essentially means 'in a near state/location'. In Estonian grammar, this would typically be used with the elative case when forming sentences about locations."
