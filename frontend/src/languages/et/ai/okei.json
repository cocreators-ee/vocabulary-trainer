  "context": "The word 'okei' is a loanword from English that has been adopted into Estonian as an informal adverb. It's used to express agreement, acknowledgment, or acceptance in casual conversation. The dictionary definition shows it means 'hästi, hea küll' (well, alright) and provides an example sentence where someone says 'Okei, oleme rääkinud' (Okay, we've talked). It functions similarly to English 'okay' but is considered more colloquial in Estonian."
