  "context": "The Estonian word 'russell' appears to be a misspelling or variant of the correct word 'karussell'. Based on the dictionary definition, 'karussell' means carousel or merry-go-round - an amusement ride with seats (like wooden horses or boats) that rotate around a vertical pole. The word can also refer to ice sleds that spin around a post at the end of a long stick, and metaphorically to something that whirls or spins like a whirlwind."
