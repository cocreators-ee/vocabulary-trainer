  "context": "The Estonian word 'siis' is an adverb meaning 'then' or 'at that time'. It's commonly used to indicate a point in time following something else mentioned. In the first sentence, it refers to a specific time when it would be good to go on vacation. The second example uses it as a reference to when someone arrives. The third example shows how it can also mean 'in that case' when referring back to a previous statement about a place being nice."
