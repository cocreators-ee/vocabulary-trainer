  "context": "The Estonian word 'siis' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can refer to a specific time (then), indicate temporal sequence (after that, subsequently), serve as a connector in conditional clauses when used with 'kui', or function as an intensifier/connector emphasizing the preceding statement. It's commonly used at the beginning of sentences to mark time references or logical connections between ideas."
