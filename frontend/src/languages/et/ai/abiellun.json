  "context": "The word 'abiellun' is the past tense form of the verb 'abielluma', which means to get married. It specifically indicates that someone has entered into marriage in the past. This is derived from the dictionary definition provided, where it's mentioned as an example of entering a new stage ('uude elujärku') in life. In Estonian grammar, this form would be used when speaking about oneself (first person) or others (third person) who have gotten married."
