  "context": "The Estonian word 'eemale' is an adverb that means 'away', 'off', or 'aside'. It indicates movement or position away from a particular point, location, or person. In the first sentence, it's used as an imperative command telling someone to move away from here. In the second example, it appears in a form indicating everyone should go away. The third example shows it in a construction meaning we need to move away."
