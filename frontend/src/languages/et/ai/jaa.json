  "context": "The word 'jaa' is an Estonian interjection and noun meaning 'yes'. As an interjection, it's used to affirm something or agree with a statement. It can be pronounced in different ways depending on the level of affirmation - from a simple 'yeah' (jaa) to expressing surprise or realization (oh jaa). The word is also declined as a noun when needed, following Estonian grammatical patterns for affirmative responses."
