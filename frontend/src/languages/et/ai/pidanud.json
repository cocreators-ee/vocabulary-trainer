  "context": "The Estonian word 'pidanud' is the past participle form of the verb 'pidama', which means 'to have to', 'must', or 'should'. It's used in combination with other verbs (usually in compound tenses) to express obligation, necessity, or what someone was supposed to do. The structure typically involves 'pidanud' + infinitive verb, similar to the English construction 'have/has/had to' + infinitive."
