  "context": "The word 'toa' is the genitive singular form of 'tuba', meaning 'of the room'. In Estonian, this case indicates possession or relationship. The dictionary definition shows it relates to a space near or behind a stove ('ahju|tagune'), suggesting it could refer to a room that was traditionally located behind a heating stove in older Estonian homes."
