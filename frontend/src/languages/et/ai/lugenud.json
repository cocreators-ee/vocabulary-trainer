  "context": "The Estonian word 'lugenud' is the past tense and past participle form of the verb 'lugema', which means 'to read'. It indicates that reading has been completed. The ending '-d' in Estonian marks this as a past participle or perfective aspect verb form, similar to how English uses 'read' (pronounced differently) for both present and simple past, but with the implication of completion in many contexts."
