  "context": "The word 'uttu' in Estonian is used to describe the process of becoming more alert, lively or awake. It often appears in contexts where someone is listening intently and waiting for something to happen, or when there's a sudden change that makes someone become more aware or energetic. The verb form suggests an ongoing state of heightened awareness."
