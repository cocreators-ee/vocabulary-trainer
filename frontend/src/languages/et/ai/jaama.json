  "context": "The word 'jaama' is a grammatical form of the Estonian noun 'jaam'. It appears in three different cases: genitive singular, partitive singular, and illative singular. In context, it's often used to show possession or relationship with a train station - for example, 'jaama lähedal' means 'near the station'. The word can also appear as 'jaamavahe' (station interval/distance between stations) in compound words like the example sentence showing the distance between Tallinn and Ülemiste."
