  "context": "The word 'nägemist' is the partitive case of the Estonian noun 'nägemine', which means 'seeing' or 'viewing'. In Estonian, it's commonly used as a polite way to say goodbye when expecting to see someone again soon. It literally translates to 'of seeing' but functions like 'goodbye' in English conversations."
