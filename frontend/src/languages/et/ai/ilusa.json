  "context": "The word 'ilusa' is the elative case form of 'iline', meaning beautiful or pretty in Estonian. The elative case indicates movement from within something, so 'ilusast' would mean 'from beautiful (something)' or 'out of beautiful (something)'. In this case, it appears to be an adjective describing beauty in different contexts."
