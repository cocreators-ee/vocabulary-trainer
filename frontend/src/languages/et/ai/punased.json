  "context": "The word 'punased' is the plural nominative form of the Estonian adjective 'punane', which means red. It describes something that has a reddish color. In the example sentence 'Jalad on külmad kui konnal, punased kui kurel,' it's used to describe feet being as red as a crane's (typically referring to cold or inflamed feet). The adjective can be inflected for gender, number and case in Estonian."
