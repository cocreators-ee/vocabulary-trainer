  "context": "The word 'värki' is a noun in Estonian that refers to an artwork, painting or drawing. It can be used to describe any visual creation made with colors. The root word comes from 'värv' meaning color, and '-ki' appears to be a suffix related to the object being created (though this may be part of a larger compound). In different contexts it could refer to a specific painting, artwork in general, or even the act of coloring depending on context."
