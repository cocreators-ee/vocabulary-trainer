  "context": "The word 'saatis' appears to be a form of the Estonian adjective 'alatasane', which means low, humble, meek, or submissive. It's used in contexts where someone is described as having a low position, being humble in demeanor, or showing subservience. The word seems to be conjugated or inflected based on context - here it appears in the partitive case 'saatis' modifying 'maokõsin' (snake-like movement)."
