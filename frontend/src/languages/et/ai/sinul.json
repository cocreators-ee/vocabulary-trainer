  "context": "The word 'sinul' is the allative case form of 'sinu' (your) and means 'to you'. It's used to indicate movement toward or direction toward someone. In Estonian grammar, the allative case answers the question 'kuhu?' (where to?). So 'sinul' specifically indicates that something goes, happens, or is directed toward you."
