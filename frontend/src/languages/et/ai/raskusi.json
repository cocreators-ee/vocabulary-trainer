  "context": "The Estonian word 'ahistama' means to harass, trouble, or torment someone. It can refer to physical harassment (like soldiers attacking), psychological torment (like worries troubling the mind), or constriction/pressure (like something pressing on the throat). The verb is in dictionary form, so 'raskusi' appears to be part of a phrase meaning 'to have difficulties/troubles' rather than the core word itself."
