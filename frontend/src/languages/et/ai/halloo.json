  "context": "The Estonian word 'halloo' is an interjection used as a greeting or to get someone's attention. It's similar in function and meaning to the English greetings 'hello,' 'hi,' or 'hey.' The dictionary examples show it being used when answering the phone ('Halloo! Kust räägitakse?' - Hello! Who is speaking?) and addressing a group of boys ('Halloo, poisid!' - Hey, boys!). It can also be used to call for someone to wait ('Oodake mind ka!' - Wait for me too!), suggesting it carries attention-getting qualities beyond just greetings."
