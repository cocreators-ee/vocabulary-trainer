  "context": "The word 'tegime' is the first person plural past tense form of the Estonian verb 'teha', which means 'to do' or 'to make'. It corresponds to English 'we did/made/performed' in simple past tense. In Estonian, as with many Finno-Ugric languages, verbs have different forms depending on person and number. 'Tegime' specifically refers to an action performed by the speaker(s) in the past."
