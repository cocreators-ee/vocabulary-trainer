  "context": "The word 'kukkunud' in Estonian describes someone who looks exactly like one of their parents, typically used to express striking resemblance. It comes from the literal meaning of 'fallen' but is used idiomatically to mean someone has seemingly 'fallen out of' or been copied directly from their parent's appearance. The word often appears in constructions like 'kukkunut ema suust' (fallen straight from mother's mouth) or similar variations with father."
