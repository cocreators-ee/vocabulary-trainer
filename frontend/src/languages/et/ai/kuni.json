  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuni' is a versatile word that can function as a conjunction, preposition, or adverb. As a conjunction, it indicates the time until which an action continues (like 'until' or 'till'). As a preposition (with terminative case), it marks boundaries in space, time, quantity, or extent (like 'up to', 'to', 'till'). As an adverb, it emphasizes the limit of some phenomenon or situation. It can connect numbers to indicate ranges (e.g., 'viis kuni kümme' means 'five to ten') and can often be omitted without changing meaning because the terminative case already conveys the boundary concept."
