  "context": "The word 'teisel' is an Estonian adessive case form of the numeral 'kaks' (two). It means 'on/at/in the second' and is used to indicate location, time, or other contexts where something is positioned at the second instance. The adessive case typically answers the question 'where?' or 'when?', so 'teisel' indicates that something happens or exists on/at/in the second (floor, day, address, etc.)."
