  "context": "The Estonian word 'liha' has multiple meanings depending on context. Primarily it means meat (as food), the flesh of animals or humans, the physical body as opposed to the soul, and in some contexts can refer to wooden structures or the interior part of fruits/vegetables. It's a versatile noun that appears in various compound words specifying types of meat (like 'kana liha' for chicken meat) or body parts ('rinnaliha' for breast muscle)."
