  "context": "The word 'naiseks' is the translative case form of 'naine', which means 'woman'. In Estonian, the translative case (-ks) indicates transformation or change into something. So 'naiseks' literally means 'as a woman' or 'into a woman'. It's used to express that someone becomes or is considered as a woman, either physically (like in a transformation), socially, or functionally."
