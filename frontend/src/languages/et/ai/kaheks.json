  "context": "The word 'kaheks' in Estonian refers to bifurcation or the splitting of something into two branches. It is commonly used in medical contexts, particularly when referring to anatomical structures like the trachea (hingetoru) that divide into two branches. The term comes from the verb 'kahenema' meaning 'to split' or 'to divide'. This word form appears to be part of a compound word or specific grammatical structure related to splitting processes."
