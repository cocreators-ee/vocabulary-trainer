  "context": "The word 'kaheks' is the Estonian partitive case form of the number 'kaks', meaning 'two'. In this case, it's specifically 'eight' in different cases. However, looking at the context more carefully, 'kaheks' appears to be a numeral form that can function as both an ordinal and cardinal number depending on usage. It typically means 'eight' when referring to quantity or position."
