  "context": "The Estonian word 'valeta' is the 3rd person singular present tense form of the verb 'valem', which means 'to lie'. It's used when someone tells an untruth or makes a false statement. The root form would be 'valema', and this is specifically the third person form - 'he/she lies'. In Estonian, verbs conjugate according to person and number, so 'valeta' specifically refers to what one person (singular) does in the present tense."
