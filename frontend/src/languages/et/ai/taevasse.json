  "context": "The Estonian word 'taevasse' is an adverbial form that means 'to the sky/heaven' or can be used metaphorically to mean 'to the highest degree' or 'excessively'. It's often used in expressions of praise, where something is elevated to the highest possible level. The word comes from 'taev' (sky/heaven) with the directional suffix '-sse', indicating movement toward the sky."
