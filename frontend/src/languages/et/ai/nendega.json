  "context": "The Estonian word 'nendega' is a combination where 'need' means 'these/those' and '-ga' is an allative case suffix meaning 'with'. It functions as an adverbial phrase indicating accompaniment or instrumentality, similar to English phrases like 'with them', 'using these', or 'by means of those'. The word follows Estonian grammar rules where the genitive form of pronouns combines with the allative case marker."
