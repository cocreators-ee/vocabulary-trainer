  "context": "The word 'nendega' is an Estonian pronoun form used in the expression 'pagan nendega'. It expresses indifference or dismissive attitude toward something, similar to English expressions like 'be that as it may', 'never mind', 'let it be', 'so what', or 'whatever'. The structure shows 'nendega' (with them/those) combined with the interjection 'pagan' which carries the meaning of dismissing or disregarding. This construction is commonly used when showing indifference to circumstances, other people's opinions, or situations one cannot control."
