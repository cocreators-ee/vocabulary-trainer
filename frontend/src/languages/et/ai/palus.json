  "context": "The word 'palus' appears to be an incomplete form of the Estonian verb 'paluma' (to ask/request) or its imperative form. In context, it's likely meant to be part of polite requests or commands. The full imperative form would typically be 'palu' (please/ask), suggesting this might be a typo or partial form. Estonian uses this root for making polite requests, similar to how English uses 'please'."
