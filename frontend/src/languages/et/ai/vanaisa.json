  "context": "The Estonian word 'vanaisa' means grandfather. It is formed from 'vana' (old/elder) + 'isa' (father). This refers to a person's father's father or mother's father - either paternal or maternal grandfather. It can also be used as a respectful term of address for an older man, similar to 'sir'. Additionally in religious contexts, it can refer to God as the Heavenly Father."
