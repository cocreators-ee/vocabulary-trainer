  "context": "The word 'pistmist' appears to be a derivative form of the Estonian word 'asi', which has multiple meanings including: 1) object/thing/matter, 2) problem/issue/question, 3) situation/circumstance, 4) work/activity/task, and 5) business/concern. The '-mist' suffix suggests it's in an illative case (into something), so 'pistmist' likely means 'into the matter/business/affair'. In common usage, it appears in phrases like 'kellegagi/millegagi asja/pistmist' meaning 'to have business/to do with someone/something'."
