  "context": "The word 'pistmist' is the elative case of 'pistmine', which means injection or prick. It indicates the state of having injected something, being in the process of injecting, or coming from an injection. In Estonian grammar, the elative case often expresses motion away from a place or origin, so this form suggests movement or action related to injections."
