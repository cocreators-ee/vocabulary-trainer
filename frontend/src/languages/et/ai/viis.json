  "context": "The Estonian word 'viis' has two main meanings: 1) As a numeral, it means the number five (e.g., used in counting, telling time, quantities). 2) It can also refer to the number 5 as an identifier (like bus number 5, apartment number 5). In grammar, 'viis' is a noun that declines with various cases: genitive 'viie', partitive 'viit'. The word comes from Proto-Uralic cognates meaning five."
