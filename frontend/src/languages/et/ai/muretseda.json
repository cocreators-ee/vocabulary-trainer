  "context": "The Estonian verb 'muretseda' means to worry or be anxious about something. It can refer both to active worrying/concerning oneself with matters and the general state of being worried. The word comes from 'mure' (worry, concern) + '-tse-' (verb-forming suffix) + '-da' (infinitive ending). When used in different forms like muretsedame (we worry) or muretseta (imperative), it maintains the core meaning of being concerned about something."
