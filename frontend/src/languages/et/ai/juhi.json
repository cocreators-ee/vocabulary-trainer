  "context": "The Estonian word 'juhi' is the genitive singular form of the noun 'juht', which means leader, manager, director, head, or boss. In the genitive case (possessive), it can mean 'of the leader/manager/director' or be used to indicate possession relationship with a leader figure. For example, 'juhi otsus' would mean 'the decision of the leader'. The word appears in educational contexts where it refers to school principals or administrative leaders."
