  "context": "\"Ülikoolis\" is the adessive case form of \"ülikool\" (university). It indicates location or state - meaning someone is at a university, studying there, or working there. The suffix \"-is\" transforms the noun into its adessive case, which answers questions like \"where?\" in relation to being at an institution. This is commonly used when referring to students attending universities or people working within academic settings."
