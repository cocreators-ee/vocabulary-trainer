  "context": "The Estonian verb 'saama' is highly versatile and commonly used. It can mean 'to get' or 'to receive' something, as in receiving a gift or information. It also means 'to become' when describing a change of state or profession. Additionally, it's used to express ability or possibility, similar to English 'can' or 'manage to', often with negative constructions like 'ei saa tulla' (cannot come). Its meaning varies significantly based on context and grammatical construction."
