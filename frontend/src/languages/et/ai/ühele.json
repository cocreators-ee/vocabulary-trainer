  "context": "Ühele is an Estonian word that functions as the allative case of 'üks' (one). It indicates movement toward or destination for one person or thing. The ending -le signifies directionality, similar to English prepositions like 'to' or 'for'. In grammar terms, it shows that something is being given, shown, or directed specifically to one individual rather than multiple people."
