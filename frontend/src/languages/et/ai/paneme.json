  "context": "The word 'paneme' is the 1st person plural present form of the verb 'pama' meaning 'to make do something'. In this context, it appears with the infinitive verb 'hüüdma' (to shout/yell), forming a causative construction. The phrase 'paneme pillid, pasunad hüüdma' means 'we make the trumpets and bugles shout/sound loudly', or more naturally in English, 'we set the trumpets and bugles sounding'. This is a common Estonian construction where 'pama' + infinitive creates a causative meaning similar to English 'make something do something' or 'set something doing something'. The word can be used for making bells ring, instruments sound loudly, or causing any loud noise-making action."
