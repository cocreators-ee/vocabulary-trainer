  "context": "The word 'paneme' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'panna', which means 'to put' or 'to place'. It indicates an action being done by a group (including the speaker) in the present moment. The '-me' ending shows it's first person plural ('we'), and the base form 'pan-' comes from the root verb 'panna'. In Estonian, this is often used when making suggestions or plans as a group, similar to 'let's put' in English."
