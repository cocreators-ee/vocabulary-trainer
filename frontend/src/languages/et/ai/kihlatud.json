  "context": "The word 'kihlatud' is the past participle of the Estonian verb 'kihluda', meaning 'to become engaged' or 'to get betrothed'. It describes a state where two people have formally agreed to marry each other. In Estonian, this is typically used for both genders in its basic form as it's a passive construction. The word indicates that the engagement has already happened and refers to the current status of being engaged."
