  "context": "Äsja is an Estonian adverb that means 'just now', 'recently', or 'a moment ago'. It indicates that something happened very recently in the past. The word was introduced into standard Estonian from South Estonian dialects and has cognates in other Finno-Ugric languages like Finnish (äsken). Examples show its use to describe recent arrivals, completed actions, and received information."
