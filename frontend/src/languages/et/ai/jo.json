  "context": "The Estonian word 'jo' is an adverb that functions similarly to English words like 'already', 'yet', or 'by now'. It indicates that something has occurred up to the present time. In the given example sentence, it's used in a context where someone hasn't eaten for a week - they're emphasizing this extended period of not eating using 'jo' (already/yet). The word can be positioned differently in sentences depending on emphasis and style."
