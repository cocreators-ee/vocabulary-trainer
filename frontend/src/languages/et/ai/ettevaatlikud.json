  "context": "Ettevaatlikud is the plural form of 'ettevaatlik', which means careful or cautious in English. It describes people who exercise care and attention, being watchful about potential dangers or mistakes. The word comes from 'ette' (forward/before) + 'vaata' (look/watch) + '-lik' (-like), essentially meaning 'looking forward/watchfully'. When used to describe multiple people, it emphasizes that they are all displaying this quality of carefulness and attentiveness."
