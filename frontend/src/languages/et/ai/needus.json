  "context": "In Estonian, 'needus' refers to a curse or doom - often an invocation of supernatural wrath that brings about misfortune. It can also refer to the state of being cursed or banished. The word carries connotations of being burdened by something harmful, whether it's literal curses from magic/negative spiritual forces, or metaphorical 'curses' like fame causing loss of privacy, where something desirable has a negative aspect. In plural form 'needused', it refers to multiple curses."
