  "context": "The Estonian word 'järgne' is related to the concept of sequence or order. It can appear in different forms depending on context - as 'järgmine' (next), 'järgnev' (following), or other derived forms. In its basic form it conveys the idea of something that comes after or follows something else, similar to English words like 'next', 'following', or 'successive'. It's commonly used to indicate temporal sequence or order in both everyday and more formal contexts."
