  "context": "Valesti is an Estonian adverb that means 'incorrectly', 'wrongly', or 'improperly'. It describes actions done in a way that is not proper, accurate, or according to requirements. The word can be used to describe physical actions (holding something incorrectly), intellectual tasks (translating wrongly), or more abstract situations (being informed incorrectly). In the example sentences, it shows different contexts: someone doing everything wrong, a child holding a pen improperly, and buttoning a coat incorrectly."
