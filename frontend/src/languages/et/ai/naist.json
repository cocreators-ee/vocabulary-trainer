  "context": "The word 'naist' is the partitive form of 'naine' meaning 'woman'. In Estonian, the partitive case often indicates an incomplete or partial action. 'Naist' can be used with negative verbs to indicate absence (e.g., 'Ei naist' means 'no women'), or as a postposition indicating lack or exclusion (e.g., 'Mul on naist' means 'I have without women')."
