  "context": "\"Ettepanek\" is an Estonian noun that means a proposal or suggestion. It refers to an idea or plan that is presented for consideration, approval, or implementation. The word can be used in various contexts such as business meetings, social situations, or formal proposals. Unlike a command (käsk), an ettepanek is merely a suggestion that the other person can accept or reject. Examples include making suggestions about activities, presenting ideas in writing or verbally, and offering recommendations for consideration."
