  "context": "The Estonian word 'peaksite' is a conditional form of the verb 'pidama', which means 'to must/should/have to'. It's in the first person singular conditional mood, equivalent to English 'I should' or 'I ought to'. This form indicates obligation or necessity but with less force than simple 'peaks' (must), suggesting something you are expected to do rather than absolutely required."
