  "context": "In Estonian, 'doktor' is a versatile word with two main meanings: 1) the highest academic degree awarded by universities, referring to someone who has earned a doctorate; 2) a physician or medical doctor, used as both a title and profession name. The word can function as a common noun when referring to people with doctoral degrees, or as a professional title for doctors. It follows Estonian grammatical patterns with specific case endings like 'doktorit' (partitive), 'doktori' (genitive), etc."
