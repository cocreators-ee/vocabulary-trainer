  "context": "The word 'maailmast' is an Estonian adessive case form, derived from the nominative singular 'maailm' (world). It indicates location or origin, meaning 'from the world' or 'out of the world'. In Estonian grammar, the adessive case typically expresses being on/at/with something, but when combined with certain verbs it can indicate coming from a place. This form is used to show where someone/something comes from or what context they originate from."
