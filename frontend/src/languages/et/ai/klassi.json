  "context": "The word 'klassi' is an illative case form of the Estonian noun 'klass', meaning 'class'. In this context, it functions as a particle or part of a phrasal construction that means 'to help someone catch up' or 'to assist in bringing someone to the required level/standard.' It's commonly used in educational contexts when helping students reach the general class level, particularly those who are struggling. The word appears to function similarly to other Estonian particles where adding '-i' can indicate direction or purpose."
