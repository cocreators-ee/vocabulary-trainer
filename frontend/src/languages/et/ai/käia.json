  "context": "The Estonian word 'käia' primarily means 'to go' or 'to walk', but it can also have extended meanings. In the context from the dictionary example, it shows how 'keel käib' uses 'käia' to mean that someone is talking non-stop (literally 'the tongue goes/walks'). The word indicates movement - either physical movement of going somewhere or figurative movement like a process functioning. It's an important verb in Estonian with various contexts and usages."
