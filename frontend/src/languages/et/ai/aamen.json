  "context": "The word 'aamen' in Estonian is an interjection used to affirm and conclude prayers or statements. It comes from Biblical Hebrew meaning 'certainly, truly.' In religious contexts, it marks the end of a prayer or church service (e.g., after the teacher's prayer). In secular usage, it signifies that something has been decisively decided with no further discussion needed - like saying 'case closed' or 'that's final'. The word carries both formal (religious) and informal (everyday) connotations in Estonian."
