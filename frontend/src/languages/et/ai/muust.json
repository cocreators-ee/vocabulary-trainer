  "context": "The word 'ainuüksi' is an adverb in Estonian meaning 'only', 'just', or 'solely'. It emphasizes that something is done exclusively or solely, without considering other possibilities or factors. In the first example sentence, it means the person didn't do something only for their own sake. In the second, it indicates a modern woman doesn't limit herself just to home and kitchen matters. The third sentence shows the speaker knows something exclusively alone."
