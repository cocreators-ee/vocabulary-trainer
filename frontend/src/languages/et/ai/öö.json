  "context": "The Estonian word 'öö' means 'night'. It refers to the dark period between evening and morning when people typically sleep. In Estonian, it's a common greeting at night (similar to 'good night' in English). The word changes form based on case - for example, 'ööd' is partitive/accusative, 'öösse' is illative, and so on. It has various compound forms like 'südaöö' (midnight), 'jõuluöö' (Christmas night), etc."
