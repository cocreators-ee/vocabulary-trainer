  "context": "The Estonian word 'tagumik' refers to the back or rear part of something. It can describe the physical back portion of a location, space, or object. For example, it might refer to the back yard/back area (tagune osa), the rear section of a field where machinery is parked, or the back part of a property where trees grow. The word comes from 'taga' meaning 'behind/back' and the suffix '-mik' which forms nouns indicating places or parts."
