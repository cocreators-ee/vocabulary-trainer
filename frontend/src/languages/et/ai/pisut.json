  "context": "Pisut is an Estonian adverb that means 'a little' or 'somewhat'. It's used to indicate a small degree or amount of something. The word comes from the root 'pisu-' which relates to smallness or slightness, and the '-t' suffix forms the adverb. In usage, pisut typically modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to express that something is done to a small extent or that there's a small amount of something."
