  "context": "The Estonian word 'vana' is an adjective that means 'old' or 'aged'. It's used to describe people, objects, or concepts that have existed for a long time. The word can refer to the physical age of someone or something (like an old man - vana mees) or it can be used more abstractly (like old friends - vanad sõbrad). In Estonian adjectives typically agree with the noun they modify in number and case, so 'vana' would become 'vanad' for plural nouns."
