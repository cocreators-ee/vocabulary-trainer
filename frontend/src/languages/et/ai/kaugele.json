  "context": "The Estonian word 'kaugele' is the adessive case form of the adjective 'kauge', which means 'far' or 'distant'. It typically indicates movement to a distant place or location. In English, it can be translated as 'to far away places', 'to distant locations', or 'remotely'. The '-le' ending is characteristic of the adessive case in Estonian, often indicating direction or destination."
