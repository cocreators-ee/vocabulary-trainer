  "context": "The word 'olemegi' is a compound form in Estonian. It consists of 'oleme' (we are) + the particle 'gi' which adds emphasis or confirmation. The particle 'gi' typically means 'also', 'too', 'indeed', or 'really', and when added to verb forms, it adds emphasis or indicates that something is obvious or expected. In this case, 'olemegi' would be used with plural first person (we are) but the structure can be adapted for other persons as well. It's similar to adding 'actually' or 'indeed' in English to add emphasis to a statement."
