  "context": "The word 'probleemi' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'probleem', meaning 'problem'. In the genitive case, it indicates possession or relationship to something - typically meaning 'of a problem' or used with verbs that require the genitive case. The stem word 'probleem' comes from the same root as English 'problem' and is used similarly in Estonian to refer to difficulties, issues, or challenges."
