  "context": "The Estonian verb 'jätta' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean to leave something behind, to abandon or desert someone/something, to omit or skip something, or to forget to do something. The word is often used with different cases - for example, when leaving something somewhere, it might be in the partitive case 'jätta midagi' (to leave something), and when describing abandonment, it could be in the genitive case 'jätta kedagi ilma millegi' (to leave someone without something)."
