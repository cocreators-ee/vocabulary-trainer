  "context": "In Estonian, 'kari' has two main meanings: 1) A herd or flock of domesticated farm animals (especially cattle), as in 'karja pidama' (to tend a herd); and 2) A reef in water. As a noun, it declines with genitive 'karja' and partitive 'karja'. Examples include experimental station herds, grazing animals, and wild animal groups like wolves moving together."
