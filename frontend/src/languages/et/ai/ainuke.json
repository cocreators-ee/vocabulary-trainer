  "context": "In Estonian, 'ainuke' is an adjective that means 'only one', 'single', or 'sole'. It can refer to something being the sole example of its kind. Additionally, in some contexts, it can mean 'beloved person' as a term of endearment, similar to how English speakers might say 'my darling'. The word can be used both in singular and plural forms (ainukesed) depending on whether it's referring to one item or multiple items."
