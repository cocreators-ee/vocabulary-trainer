  "context": "The word 'küsimusi' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'küsimus', which means 'question'. In Estonian, the partitive case often indicates partialness or indefiniteness. When used in plural as 'küsimusi', it typically refers to multiple questions without specifying an exact number, similar to how we might say 'some questions' or simply refer to questions in general in English. This form is commonly used when talking about asking questions, answering questions, or discussing various topics where questions are involved."
