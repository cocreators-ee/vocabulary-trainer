  "context": "'Kingituse' is the genitive singular form of 'kingitus', which means 'gift' or 'present'. In Estonian, the genitive case typically indicates possession or association - so 'kingituse' means 'of a gift' or 'belonging to a gift'. It's used when you want to show that something is related to or belongs to a gift. For example, if you were looking for something specific of a gift (like its wrapping) or talking about qualities associated with the gift."
