  "context": "The Estonian word 'mulle' is a pronoun in the allative case, derived from the personal pronoun 'minu' (my/me). It indicates that something is directed towards or intended for the speaker. In English, it translates to expressions like 'to me', 'for me', or simply 'me'. This form is commonly used with verbs of giving, speaking, or when indicating who benefits from an action."
