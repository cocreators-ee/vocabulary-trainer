  "context": "The word 'oleksite' is a conditional form of the Estonian verb 'olema' (to be). It specifically refers to the second person plural ('te' - you) in the conditional mood. This is used when speaking to someone formally or to multiple people, expressing what would happen if something were true. The word combines the root 'olk-' (from 'olla') with the suffix '-site' indicating second person plural and the conditional '-ks' form."
