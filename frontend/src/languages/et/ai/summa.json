  "context": "The Estonian word 'summa' has two main meanings: 1) In mathematics, it refers to the result of addition (the sum of numbers), as in '7 ja 5 summa on 12' meaning '7 and 5 sum is 12'. 2) It can also refer to a monetary amount or sum of money, such as when discussing finances, loans, payments, or costs. The word follows standard Estonian noun declension patterns with forms like summat (partitive), summast (elative), etc."
