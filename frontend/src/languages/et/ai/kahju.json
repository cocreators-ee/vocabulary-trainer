  "context": "The Estonian word 'kahju' is a versatile noun with multiple meanings. It can refer to physical damage or loss (like frost damaging apple trees), material/financial losses suffered by a company, emotional harm, or as an expression of sympathy/pity for others. The word also functions in common expressions of regret or apology (similar to saying 'too bad' or 'what a shame'). Its declension shows it belongs to two different noun types (ÕS type 16/pere and ÕS type 17/elu), both with similar forms but slightly different partitive cases."
