  "context": "The Estonian word 'täpsemalt' is an adverb that means 'more precisely' or 'more specifically.' It is formed by adding the comparative suffix '-malt' to the adjective 'täpsed' (precise). This adverb is used to ask for or provide more detailed information when something needs clarification. In sentences, it typically appears before the verb or at the beginning of a clause to indicate that greater precision should be applied."
