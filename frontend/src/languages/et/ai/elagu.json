  "context": "The word 'elagu' is an Estonian interjection used as a formal cheer, greeting or congratulatory expression. It's similar to English cheers/hooray/long live and is typically shouted in celebration of someone's achievement, birthday, wedding anniversary, or other happy occasions. The word appears to be derived from 'elu' (life) with the '-ga' suffix indicating accompaniment or association - literally meaning 'with life'."
