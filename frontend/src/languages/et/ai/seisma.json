  "context": "The Estonian verb 'seisma' primarily means 'to stand' but has several extended meanings including 'to stop', 'to remain', and 'to be preserved'. It can refer to physical standing (like a person standing), stopping movement, remaining in a state or position, or even defending something. The word forms different conjugations: present tense like 'seisan' (I stand), 'seisad' (you stand), past tense like 'seisin' (I stood), and imperative form like 'Seisa!' (Stand!). It can be used both literally (physical standing) and figuratively (remaining in a state, defending principles)."
