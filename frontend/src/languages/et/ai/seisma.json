  "context": "The Estonian verb 'seisma' is the basic infinitive form meaning 'to stand'. It's an imperfective verb that describes a state of being in an upright position on one's feet. The word changes form depending on tense, person, and number - for example, 'seisan' means I stand (present), 'seisad' means you stand (informal singular), 'seisev' means standing (present participle). It's commonly used in everyday situations to describe someone being physically upright rather than sitting or lying down."
