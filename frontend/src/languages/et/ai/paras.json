  "context": "The Estonian word 'paras' is a versatile adjective with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'suitable, appropriate, proper, fitting' when describing things that are just right or well-matched. It can also mean 'big, nice, good' to describe something of good quality or size. Additionally, as an interjection, it expresses schadenfreude - a sense of satisfaction at someone else's misfortune, similar to saying 'good for him!' when someone gets what they deserve. The word has different case forms including paraja (genitive), parajat/partitive (partitive), and parajad (plural)."
