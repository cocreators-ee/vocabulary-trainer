  "context": "In Estonian, 'paras' is an adjective meaning 'the best' or 'excellent'. It's the superlative form of the adjective 'parem' which means 'better'. 'Paras' can be used to describe something as being of the highest quality, superior, or excellent. When using this word in different grammatical contexts, it may need to agree with the noun it modifies in terms of gender (naissool/naistel), number (mitmus) and case."
