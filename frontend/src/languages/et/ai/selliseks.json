  "context": "The Estonian word 'selliseks' is an illative case form of the demonstrative pronoun 'selline', meaning 'such' or 'this'. It typically indicates movement toward or transformation into a certain state. In English, it can be translated as 'like this', 'into such a state', or 'to become like this'. This form shows directionality - something is becoming or entering the state described by 'selline'. The illative case in Estonian answers the question 'kuhu?' (where to?), indicating movement toward something."
