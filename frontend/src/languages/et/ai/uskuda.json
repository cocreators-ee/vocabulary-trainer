  "context": "The Estonian word 'uskuda' means to believe, trust, or have faith in something. It's a verb that expresses confidence in the truth of something or someone, similar to how 'believe' functions in English. The dictionary definition mentions it can mean 'suutma v. tahtma' (to be able to want/willing), but its primary meaning is about belief and trust."
