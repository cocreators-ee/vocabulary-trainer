  "context": "The word 'naisega' appears to be a typographical error in the dictionary definitions provided. Looking at the context, it seems this should actually be the word 'jooksma' (to run) which is the base form of the verb being defined throughout the dictionary entry. The example sentences show different conjugations of this verb: 'lähenes joostes' (approached running), 'jookseb nagu kits' (runs like a goat), and 'jooksin Maiega võidu' (ran with Mai). This is an Estonian verb meaning to run, used for both people and animals moving quickly on foot."
