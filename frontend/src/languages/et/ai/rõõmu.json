  "context": "The Estonian word 'ah' is an interjection that serves multiple purposes depending on context. It can express joy and delight (like 'Ah, what beautiful weather today!'), convey surprise or sudden realization ('Ah yes - today is Leena's birthday!'), or be used as a conversational acknowledgment ('Ah, I see'). This versatile interjection functions similarly to English exclamations like 'Oh,' 'Ah,' or Wow' but carries specific cultural nuances in Estonian communication. It often appears at the beginning of sentences to emphasize emotional content and can convey various feelings from positive delight to mild frustration depending on context, tone, and accompanying body language."
