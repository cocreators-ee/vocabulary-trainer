  "context": "The word 'kadunud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'kada', meaning to lose something or someone. It describes a state where something or someone has been lost, missing, or disappeared and their current location is unknown. This form is commonly used with the verb 'olema' (to be) - for example, 'on kadunud' means 'is lost/missing'. The word can refer to both physical objects that have been misplaced and people who have gone missing."
