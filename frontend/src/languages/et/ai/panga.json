  "context": "The word 'panga' is the genitive case form of 'pank', which means 'bank' in English. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case typically indicates possession or relationship, and can often translate to English as 'of' or be used with possessive pronouns. When used alone like this, it functions similarly to how we might say 'the bank's services' or refer to banking concepts in general."
