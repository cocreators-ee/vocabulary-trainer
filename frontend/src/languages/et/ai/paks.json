  "context": "The Estonian word 'paks' is an adjective with multiple meanings depending on context. It primarily means 'thick' in terms of physical dimensions or substance (like thick materials), but can also describe people as 'fat' or 'chubby', refer to dense growths of vegetation, describe thick liquids or pastes, and even be used metaphorically for coarse or bold speech. The word changes form based on case, number, and comparison in Estonian grammar."
