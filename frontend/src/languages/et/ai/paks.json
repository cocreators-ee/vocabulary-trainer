  "context": "In Estonian, 'paks' is an adjective that means both 'fat' (referring to a person's body size) and 'thick' (referring to physical dimensions). It can be used to describe people who are overweight or objects that have considerable thickness. The word changes form based on case, number, and gender - for example, 'paksem' is the comparative form meaning 'fatter' or 'thicker', while 'pakseim' would be the superlative form."
