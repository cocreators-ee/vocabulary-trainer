  "context": "The word 'kuue' appears to be a misspelling or variant form of 'kitarr' (guitar) in Estonian. The dictionary definition shows that 'kitarr' is the correct term for guitar, and it describes various types including acoustic guitars with different numbers of strings and resonator bodies. In context, 'kuue' might refer to a six-stringed guitar or could be an error for the more common word 'kitarr'."
