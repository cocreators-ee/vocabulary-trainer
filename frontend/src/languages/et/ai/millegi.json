  "context": "The word 'millegi' is the elative case form of the pronoun 'midagi', meaning 'of something' or 'about something'. It indicates movement away from or origin from something, and it's used to express that someone learns about or acquires knowledge related to a particular subject area. In Estonian grammar, this is formed by adding the suffix '-gi' to the stem 'mille-' which comes from 'midagi' (something)."
