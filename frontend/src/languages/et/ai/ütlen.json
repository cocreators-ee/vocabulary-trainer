  "context": "The word 'ütlen' is the first person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'ütlema', which means 'to say' or 'to tell'. It's commonly used to express what someone is saying at the moment. The dictionary shows it appears in phrases like 'Ütlen seda sulle ainult nelja silma all.' (I'm telling this to you only under four eyes/privately). This verb form indicates that the speaker is actively stating or communicating something."
