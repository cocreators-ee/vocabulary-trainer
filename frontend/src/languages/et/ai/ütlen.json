  "context": "\"Ütlen\" is the first-person singular present form of the Estonian verb \"ütelda,\" which means 'to say' or 'to tell.' It's commonly used when someone wants to express what they are saying at the current moment. The word can be followed by direct speech, indirect speech, or information being communicated. In different contexts, it can translate to English as 'I say,' 'I tell,' or 'I speak.' When conjugated for other persons or tenses, the stem changes: \"ütelda\" (infinitive), \"ütleme\" (we say/tell), \"ütleksid\" (you would say)."
