  "context": "The Estonian word 'asemel' is used as a postposition (placed after a noun) to indicate substitution or replacement. It shows that one thing, person, or action is taking the place of another expected or usual item. For example, 'Või asemel tarvitati margariini' means 'Instead of butter, margarine was used.' The word can be translated as 'instead of,' 'in place of,' or 'as a substitute for' in English. It's commonly used when contrasting what happened versus what was expected to happen."
