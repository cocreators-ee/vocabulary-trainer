  "context": "\"Silmitsi\" is an Estonian adverb meaning 'face to face' or 'directly opposite'. It describes being positioned so that people are facing each other directly. The word comes from the root word 'silm' (eye) and indicates a close, direct confrontation or encounter. It can be used both literally when people physically stand facing each other, and metaphorically when confronting someone or something directly."
