  "context": "The Estonian word 'lugema' is a versatile verb with multiple meanings. Its primary meaning is 'to read', referring to the act of deciphering written text or printed material. It can also mean 'to count' as in counting numbers or items, and 'to matter' when referring to something having importance or significance. The dictionary shows extensive usage examples demonstrating these different contexts - from reading books and newspapers to counting money, people, and time, and to indicating whether something matters or has value."
