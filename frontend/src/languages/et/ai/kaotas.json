  "context": "The word 'kaotas' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'kaotama', which means to lose, be defeated, or misplace something. It indicates that someone no longer has possession of something they once had, whether it's a physical object, money, game, competition, or opportunity. The word shows completion of an action in the past where loss occurred."
