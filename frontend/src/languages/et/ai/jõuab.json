  "context": "The Estonian word 'jõuab' is the 3rd person singular present tense form of the verb 'jõua', which means 'to reach' or 'to arrive'. It indicates that someone or something reaches a destination at a specific time. The root word 'jõud-' suggests achievement of arrival, and the suffix '-a' makes it a present tense verb ending for 3rd person singular subject."
