  "context": "The word 'vastust' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'vastus', which means 'answer'. The partitive case is used when referring to a portion, amount, or indefinite quantity of something. In this case, 'vastust' would be used when talking about an answer (indefinite or partial) rather than a specific, complete answer. It can also appear in various constructions like with prepositions indicating movement towards the answer."
