  "context": "The word 'paati' is the partitive form of 'paat' (boat) in Estonian. It indicates that something is being done with or to a boat, rather than referring to the entire boat as a complete entity. In English, it would translate to 'a boat' or 'some boat', but often just 'boat' depending on context."
