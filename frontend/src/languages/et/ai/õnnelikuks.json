  "context": "The word 'õnnelikuks' is the elative case form of 'õnnelik', which means happy or fortunate. In Estonian grammar, the elative case (-ks ending) indicates movement out of something or transformation into a state. So 'õnnelikuks' specifically means 'into happiness' or 'making [someone/something] happy/fortunate'. It's often used when describing the process or result of becoming happy or fortunate."
