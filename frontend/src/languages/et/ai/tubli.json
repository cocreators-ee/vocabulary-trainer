  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'tubli' has multiple related meanings. Primarily it means 'good', 'fine', or 'fair' when describing something as worthy of praise, suitable for its purpose, or meeting expectations. It can describe people as capable and successful in their endeavors (e.g., 'tubli töömees' - a good worker), objects as sturdy and fit for use (e.g., 'tubli kiik' - a good swing), or situations/achievements as praiseworthy. In some contexts, it can also mean 'strong' or 'firm' when describing physical attributes or intensity (like 'tubli müks' - strong muscles). As an interjection, it means 'Good for you!' expressing approval or congratulations."
