  "context": "The word 'lennuk' in Estonian is a noun meaning airplane or aeroplane. It refers to a powered flying vehicle with fixed wings that is heavier than air. The word comes from the verb 'lendama' which means 'to fly'. In Estonian, this would be used similarly to how we say 'airplane' in English when referring to any type of powered aircraft for transportation."
