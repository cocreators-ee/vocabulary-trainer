  "context": "The word 'vormis' is an Estonian adverb that describes a state of being physically fit or in good shape. It's commonly used to refer to athletes being in optimal physical condition for competition, but can also be used more generally to describe someone who is well-toned and physically healthy. The word comes from the same root as 'vorm' (form), suggesting it relates to having a good form or structure physically."
