  "context": "The word 'vormis' is in the Estonian instrumental case, meaning 'in a form' or 'in a mold'. It indicates that something is shaped into a particular form or mold. This suffix '-s' changes the noun to show what instrument or means was used for an action. For example, when baking cakes, you might use different forms or molds to give them specific shapes."
