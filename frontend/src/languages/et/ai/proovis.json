  "context": "The word 'proovis' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'proovima', which means 'to try'. In this case, it specifically refers to attempting or trying something in the past. The dictionary entry provided appears to be for a different word (ohtrus), so I'm focusing on the common usage of 'proovis' as the past tense of 'to try'. It is used when someone has attempted to do something in the past."
