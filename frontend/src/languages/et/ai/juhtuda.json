  "context": "The Estonian word 'kartus' refers to a feeling of fear, apprehension, or anxiety about something bad or undesirable happening. It can indicate a mild form of fear that gnaws at one's heart and soul. The word is used in various contexts such as health concerns (fear for a sick child), fears about the future (dread of the coming dark night), or fears related to specific situations (restrictions imposed during a flu epidemic due to fear). It can also be used as part of compound words to indicate sensitivity or vulnerability to something, like 'külma kartus' (cold sensitivity) or 'valgusekartus' (light sensitivity)."
