  "context": "The verb 'juhtuda' in Estonian means to happen, occur or take place. It is an impersonal verb used when talking about events that happen without a specific agent doing the action. For example: 'Täna juhtub midagi good' (Today something good will happen). The word comes from 'juht-' meaning 'to lead' but in this form it's used for occurrences and events rather than leadership."
