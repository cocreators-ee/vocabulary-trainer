  "context": "The Estonian word 'eelnevalt' is an adverb that means previously, beforehand, or earlier. It indicates something that happened before another time or event. The word breaks down as 'eeln-' (related to 'eel', meaning before) and '-evalt' (an adverbial suffix), literally translating to 'in a before manner'. This adverb is commonly used in formal contexts and is often found in written Estonian."
