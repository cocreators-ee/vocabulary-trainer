  "context": "The Estonian word 'varem' is an adverb meaning 'earlier', 'before', or 'sooner'. It indicates that something happened at a previous time than expected or being compared. In the examples, it's used to show that someone arrived earlier than anticipated, suggesting leaving earlier should be done, and asking if someone can arrive sooner."
