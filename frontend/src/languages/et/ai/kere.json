  "context": "The Estonian word 'kere' has multiple meanings. 1) In anatomy/human body context: it refers to the central part of the body, the torso or trunk - the body without head and limbs. It can also refer more generally to the whole body in everyday language. Example sentences show usage like 'Kere jaguneb rindkereks ja kõhuks' (The torso is divided into chest and abdomen) and 'Tal oli keret ja jõudu' (He had body and strength). 2) In technical context: it refers to the central/main structure of vehicles, buildings or objects that other parts are attached to. Examples include ships ('Laeva kere'), airplanes, automobiles, etc. This meaning can be seen in 'Laeva, paadi, purjeka kere'. The word also has a colloquial sense referring to the stomach or belly."
