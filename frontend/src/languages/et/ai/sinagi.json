  "context": "The word 'sinagi' in Estonian is used to mean 'also', 'too', or 'so also'. It's a compound word consisting of 'sina' (you) and '-gi' (also/too), but when combined it functions as an adverb indicating addition or inclusion. In the examples provided, it appears to be used in contexts where someone is expressing that something applies equally to another person or thing. The first example suggests living like the sun in nature's vastness, while the second shows Orinake telling about worries of similar magnitude."
