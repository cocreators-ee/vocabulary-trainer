  "context": "The word 'nägemiseni' is an Estonian compound noun formed from 'nägemine' (seeing/meeting) and the suffix '-ni' which indicates 'until'. It's used as a farewell expression meaning 'until we see each other again' or 'until our next meeting'. This is similar to English phrases like 'see you later' or 'until next time', but specifically emphasizes the anticipation of seeing someone again."
