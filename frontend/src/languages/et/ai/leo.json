  "context": "The word 'leo' in Estonian can have two main meanings. First, it is a common Estonian male name, equivalent to the English name 'Leo'. Second, when used as a noun, it refers to a lion, which is the same meaning as in many other languages including English and Latin. In most contexts where you would see 'leo' in Estonian text, it will likely be referring to someone's name rather than the animal, unless specifically mentioned in context such as talking about animals or wildlife."
