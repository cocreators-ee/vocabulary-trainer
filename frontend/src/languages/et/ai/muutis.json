  "context": "The word 'muutis' is the past tense third person singular form of the Estonian verb 'muutma', which means 'to change'. In this context, it refers to changing one's physical position or stance. The dictionary definition shows that 'asend' (position/stance) was likely being changed. This word would be used when someone physically changes their posture, stance, or position in space."
