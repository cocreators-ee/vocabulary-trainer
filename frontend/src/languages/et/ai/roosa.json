  "context": "The word 'roosa' is the nominative singular form of an adjective in Estonian that means pink or rosy. It describes something with a light red color, typically associated with rose flowers. In Estonian grammar, adjectives must agree in number and case with the nouns they modify. The 'a' ending suggests it's likely the basic form of this adjective."
