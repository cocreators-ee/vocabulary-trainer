  "context": "Roosa is an Estonian adjective that primarily means 'pink' in color, referring to the light red color associated with roses. It's also used figuratively to describe someone as cheerful or optimistic (rosy), and politically it can refer to a person who leans left but not fully communist (left-wing). As a noun, roosa can mean pink color itself or lesbian. The word appears in many compound words specifying different shades of pink."
