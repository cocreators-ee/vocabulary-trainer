  "context": "The Estonian word 'unistus' means dream or fantasy. It can refer to both literal dreams during sleep and metaphorical dreams/aspirations for the future. This word is in the nominative singular form, which is the dictionary form of the noun. In different cases and numbers it would change - for example, 'unistused' (nominative plural) means dreams, and 'unistuse' (genitive singular) means of a dream."
