  "context": "The Estonian word 'küsige' is the plural imperative form of the verb 'küsidama', meaning to ask or request. It is used when addressing multiple people directly, telling them to ask something. The '-ge' ending indicates it's a plural command form. This would be used in formal instructions when speaking to a group, such as 'Please ask for help from us' or asking a group to inquire about permission."
