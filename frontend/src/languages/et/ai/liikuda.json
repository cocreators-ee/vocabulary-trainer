  "context": "The Estonian verb 'liikuda' means to move or travel. It's an infinitive form that can be conjugated into different tenses and aspects. The root 'liik-' relates to movement, and the '-uda' ending is typical for Estonian infinitives. This verb describes physical motion from one place to another, similar to English 'to move' but specifically focused on the action of moving itself rather than relocation."
