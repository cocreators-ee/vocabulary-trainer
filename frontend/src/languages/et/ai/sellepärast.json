  "context": "The Estonian word 'sellepärast' is an adverb that means 'because', 'that's why', or 'for that reason'. It indicates a cause-and-effect relationship and can be used to explain the reason for something. In addition to its primary meaning of 'because', it can also mean 'nevertheless' or 'still' in some contexts, particularly when combined with 'et' (sellepärast et = because). The word is composed of 'selle' (of that) and 'pärast' (after/behind), literally translating to 'for that reason'. It's commonly used in both spoken and written Estonian to provide explanations or reasons for actions or statements."
