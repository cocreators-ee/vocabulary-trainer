  "context": "The Estonian word 'sellepärast' is an adverb meaning 'therefore', 'that's why', or 'for that reason'. It is used to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship, typically appearing at the beginning of a clause to introduce a consequence or result. The word can be broken down as 'selle' (this/that) + 'pärast' (after/because of), literally meaning 'because of this/that'."
