  "context": "The word 'suletud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'sulguma', which means 'to close' or 'to shut'. It describes something that has been closed or is in a closed state. This form is used to indicate that an action of closing has already occurred, similar to how '-ed' forms work in English for past actions."
