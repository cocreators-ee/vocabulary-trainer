  "context": "Kõigepealt is an Estonian adverb meaning 'first of all' or 'before anything else'. It's used to indicate the priority sequence of actions, events, or importance. The word has three main usages: 1) indicating chronological order (what happens first in time), 2) emphasizing primary importance or priority (above all, primarily), and 3) as an introductory marker in enumerations (firstly). Examples show it can be used to indicate the first action in a sequence ('Tourists went to the hotel first'), the most important aspect of something ('For Tallinn's attractions, first and foremost is the Old Town'), or when listing items where it would correspond to 'firstly'."
