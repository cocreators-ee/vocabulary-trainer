  "context": "The Estonian word 'näib' is a third-person singular form of the verb 'näima', which means 'to seem', 'to appear', or 'to look'. It's used when someone or something appears to be in a certain way from an observer's perspective. The word indicates a perception rather than necessarily being factual."
