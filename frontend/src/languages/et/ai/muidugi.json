  "context": "Muidugi is an Estonian adverb used to express certainty, agreement, or something that goes without saying. It's commonly translated as 'of course' in English and can also mean 'certainly,' 'naturally,' or 'obviously.' The word reinforces what has been said or makes a statement more emphatic. From the dictionary definitions, it can be used to acknowledge something is self-evident (meaning 1) or even with a slightly concessive meaning like 'even' in some contexts (meaning 2)."
