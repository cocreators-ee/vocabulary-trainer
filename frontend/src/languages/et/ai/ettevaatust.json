  "context": "The word 'ettevaatust' is the elative case of the Estonian noun 'ettevatus', which means caution or care. It's used as an expression similar to 'be careful' in English, often as a warning or reminder to exercise caution. The form '-tus' at the end indicates it's in the elative case, suggesting movement out from something - in this case, 'out of caution' or 'from a state of care'."
