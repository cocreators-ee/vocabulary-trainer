  "context": "The word 'sellelt' is an Estonian adessive case form of the demonstrative pronoun 'see'. It functions as a prepositional phrase meaning 'from that' or 'off that one', indicating origin, separation, or source. In botanical contexts like the definition provided, it indicates where something comes from without taking nutrients - in this case, an epiphyte growing on another plant without drawing nutrients from its host."
