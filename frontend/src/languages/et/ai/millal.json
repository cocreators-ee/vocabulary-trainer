  "context": "The Estonian word 'millal' is an adverb that functions as a question word asking about time. It corresponds to English 'when' and is used in various contexts: 1) In direct questions about specific times (e.g., when will the train arrive?), 2) To introduce temporal clauses showing when something happens, and 3) To refer to unspecified or indefinite times. The word has synonyms like 'kunas' but 'millal' is more commonly used as the standard interrogative adverb for asking about time."
