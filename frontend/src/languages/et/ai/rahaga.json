  "context": "The word 'alahastatakse' is the 3rd person singular present form of the verb 'alarahastama', which means 'to underfund'. It refers to providing insufficient financial resources for something, typically public services like infrastructure, healthcare, education, or cultural institutions. When something is alarahastatud (underfunded), it lacks adequate funding to function properly, leading to problems such as deteriorating roads, inadequate healthcare systems, or struggling educational and cultural organizations."
