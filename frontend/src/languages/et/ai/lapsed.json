  "context": "The word 'lapsed' is the nominative plural form of the Estonian noun 'laps', which means 'child'. In Estonian, nouns change their endings based on grammatical case and number. Here, 'lapsed' specifically refers to multiple children (more than one child). This is a very common word in everyday Estonian language when talking about children in general or referring to a group of children."
