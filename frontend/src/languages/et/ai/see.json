  "context": "The Estonian word 'see' is a demonstrative pronoun that means 'this' or 'that'. It's used to point out specific objects, people, or concepts. In its basic form, it can refer to something near the speaker ('this') but doesn't have strict distance distinctions like some other languages. The word changes form depending on case: nominative 'see', accusative 'seda', genitive 'selles', etc."
