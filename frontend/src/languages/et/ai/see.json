It's used to refer to people, animals, objects, situations, or concepts near the speaker or in the immediate context of conversation. In Northern Estonia and standard Estonian, it serves both as proximal ('this') and distal ('that') determiner. The word has various forms including singular (see) and plural (need), with different cases for grammatical functions."
