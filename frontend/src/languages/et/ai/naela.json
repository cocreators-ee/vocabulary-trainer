  "context": "The word 'naela' appears to be an old Estonian unit of weight equivalent to what is called a 'leisikas'. Based on the dictionary definition provided, one leisikas equals 20 naela. This suggests that 'naela' was a smaller unit in this historical measurement system used in the Baltic region and Northern Europe. The examples given show it being used for measuring agricultural products like flax and pork fat."
