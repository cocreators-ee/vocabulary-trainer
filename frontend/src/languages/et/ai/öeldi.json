  "context": "The word 'öeldi' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'öelda', which means 'to say'. It's in the 3rd person singular passive form, used when someone says something but the speaker isn't specifying who exactly said it. This construction is common in narrative contexts where the focus is on what was communicated rather than who communicated it."
