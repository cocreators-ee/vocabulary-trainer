  "context": "The Estonian word 'käsi' primarily means 'hand' or 'arm'. It can refer to the human upper limb from shoulder to fingers, but more specifically refers to the hand part. The word appears in various contexts: as a body part (clean hands, cold hands), for actions performed with hands (waving, clapping, touching), in figurative expressions (future is in our hands), and even in some specialized meanings like indicating direction (right/left hand) or side of something."
