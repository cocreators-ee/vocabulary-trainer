  "context": "The word 'mängivad' is the 3rd person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'mängima', meaning 'to play'. However, in this context from O. Luts's text, it appears to be used metaphorically to describe stomach noises or rumbling sounds when hungry, similar to how English might say 'my stomach is playing up' or 'making noise'. The sentence structure suggests the soolikad (stomachs) are 'playing' due to hunger."
