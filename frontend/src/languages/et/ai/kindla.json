  "context": "The phrase 'kindla peale' is an Estonian idiom that means 'definitely', 'certainly', or 'for sure'. It's used when someone wants to express complete certainty about something, often with the implication of being on a sure foundation or taking a safe approach. In the first sentence example, it refers to playing it safe rather than taking risks. In the second example, it indicates that someone is definitely at home now. The phrase literally translates roughly to 'onto something firm/sure', conveying the idea of certainty and reliability."
