  "context": "The Estonian word 'kindla' is the partitive singular form of 'kindel', which means definite, certain, sure or positive. It's used to indicate that something is specific rather than general, or that there is certainty about a matter. In the examples, it shows different contexts: 1) referring to a specific date (definite), 2) emphasizing certainty about an answer (sure/certain), and 3) expressing definite intention (will definitely do)."
