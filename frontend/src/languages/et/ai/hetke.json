  "context": "In Estonian, 'hetke' is the partitive case form of the word 'hetk', which means 'moment' or 'instant'. It's used to express a brief period of time. The partitive case in Estonian often indicates partialness, limitation or duration. So when someone says 'ootan hetke', they mean they are waiting for a moment/short while."
