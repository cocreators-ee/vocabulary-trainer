  "context": "The Estonian word 'lukus' is an adverb that means something is in a locked or closed state. It can refer to physical objects like doors being locked ('uks on lukus'), things being kept shut ('hoiab suu lukus' - keep mouth shut), or metaphorically describe emotions or feelings being contained and inaccessible ('ta hing on lukus' - his spirit/essence is sealed away). The word emphasizes that something is securely closed and cannot be opened without the appropriate action."
