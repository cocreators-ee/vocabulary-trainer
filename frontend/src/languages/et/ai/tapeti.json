  "context": "The Estonian word 'tapeti' is the partitive form of the noun 'tapeet', which means wallpaper. The partitive case in Estonian indicates an incomplete or indefinite quantity, so 'tapeti' would typically be used when referring to some wallpaper (not specifying how much) or as the object of a verb where the quantity isn't fully specified."
