  "context": "The word 'tapeti' appears to be a form of the Estonian verb 'tapetud', which means 'slaughtered' or 'killed'. In the context provided, it's used in phrase värsket 'tapeti' loom (fresh slaughtered animal). This is related to meat/flesh from animals that have been killed for food. The word appears to be part of a compound expression where it modifies 'loom' (animal) to indicate the animal has been slaughtered."
