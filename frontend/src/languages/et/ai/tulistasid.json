  "context": "The word 'tulistasid' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'tulistama', which means to shoot or fire a weapon. It specifically refers to the action of firing a gun, rifle, or other firearm. The word appears to be derived from 'plaksuma' (to make a clapping/banging sound) and describes the characteristic sound made when a firearm is discharged."
