  "context": "The Estonian word 'äärde' is a directional case form (illative) of the noun 'ääre', which means 'edge'. It indicates movement toward or arrival at an edge. The illative case in Estonian shows motion towards something, so 'äärde' specifically means 'to the edge' or 'at the edge', indicating that someone or something has moved to a position at the edge of something."
