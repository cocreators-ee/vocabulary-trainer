  "context": "The Estonian word 'äärde' is a postposition (postp) that indicates movement towards or placement next to the edge of something. It can be translated as 'to the edge of', 'next to', 'towards', or 'beside'. This form appears in the genitive case and shows direction/approach to an edge - like going to the water's edge, a ship reaching the dock's edge, or sitting by the campfire's edge. It's commonly used with locations and objects to indicate proximity or approach to their boundaries."
