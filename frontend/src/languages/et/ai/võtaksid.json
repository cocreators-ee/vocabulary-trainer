  "context": "The word 'võtaksid' is the conditional form of the verb 'võtma' (to take/carry/bring). It's used to express a hypothetical situation or polite request, similar to English 'would take'. This form appears in third person plural (they would take) and can be conjugated with different subjects. The base verb 'võtma' is very versatile in Estonian, meaning to take, carry, bring, accept, or understand depending on context."
