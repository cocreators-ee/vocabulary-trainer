  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuulda' in this context means there is no sign or evidence of something existing or happening. It's often used with 'pole' (is not) to express absence, such as when you can't see any indication that someone or something should be present. For example, 'Ei ole haisugi kodus' means 'There's no sign of anyone at home.' This idiom suggests a complete lack of evidence for the presence or occurrence of what is expected."
