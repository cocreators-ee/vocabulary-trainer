  "context": "The Estonian word 'üks' is the numeral for 1. It can be used as a number (like in mathematical expressions), to indicate quantity (only one person lives there), or as an indefinite pronoun meaning someone/something (a certain king lived once). The word has various forms depending on grammatical case: nominative üks, genitive ühe, partitive üht/ühte, illative ühte, etc. It's a fundamental word in Estonian that serves both as the number 1 and as an indefinite reference to objects or people."
