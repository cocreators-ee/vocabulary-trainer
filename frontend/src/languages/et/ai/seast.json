  "context": "The Estonian word 'seast' is a postpositive genitive form meaning 'from among', 'out of', or 'from within'. It indicates that something or someone is being selected, separated, or taken from a larger group, collection, or category. For example, when saying 'teiste seast' (from others), it means selecting something from the midst of other things. The word appears to be part of the elative case system in Estonian grammar."
