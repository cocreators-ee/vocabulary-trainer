  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõrvale' has multiple meanings depending on context. As a postposition (genitive case), it means 'beside', 'next to', or 'to the side of someone/something'. For example, 'Istu minu kõrvale!' means 'Sit beside me!'. It can also mean 'additionally' or 'apart from' when used in phrases like 'supi kõrvale söödi leiba' (bread was eaten with soup). As an adverb, it means 'to the side', indicating direction away from a central point, such as 'astus paar sammu kõrvale' (stepped aside a couple of steps)."
