  "context": "Võibolla is an Estonian adverb that means 'maybe', 'perhaps', or 'possibly'. It's used to express uncertainty or possibility about something happening. The word can be broken down into components: 'või' meaning 'or', and 'bolla' being a colloquial form, together forming the concept of 'it is possible that'. This adverb is commonly used in everyday conversation to indicate that something might happen but it's not certain."
