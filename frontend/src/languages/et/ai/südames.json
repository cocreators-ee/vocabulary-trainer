  "context": "The Estonian word 'südames' is the inessive case (local case indicating location inside something) of the noun 'süda', which means 'heart'. It indicates being located within someone's heart or at a person's heart. This form typically follows a possessive pronoun (like minu - my, sinu - your, tema - his/her) to show whose heart we're talking about."
