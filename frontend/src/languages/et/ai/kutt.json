  "context": "In Estonian, 'kutt' specifically refers to a female dog. It's the feminine form of the word 'koer' which means dog in general. While it can literally translate to 'bitch' in English, this term is often considered offensive when referring to dogs in English, whereas 'kutt' is a neutral and commonly used term in Estonian to specify that you're talking about a female dog."
