  "context": "The Estonian word 'tavalised' is the plural form of the adjective 'tavane', which means usual, ordinary or common. It describes something that is normal, typical, or not special in some way. The '-d' ending indicates it's in plural form, so it would be used with plural nouns to describe them as being ordinary or typical rather than unusual or exceptional."
