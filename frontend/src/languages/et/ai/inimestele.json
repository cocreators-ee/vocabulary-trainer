  "context": "The word 'inimestele' is the allative case plural form of 'inimene', which means 'person' or 'human being'. In Estonian, the allative case indicates movement towards or direction to something. So 'inimestele' specifically means 'to people' or 'toward people'. It's used when you're going toward people, giving something to people, or directing actions toward people."
