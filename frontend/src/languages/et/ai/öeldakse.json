  "context": "The Estonian word 'öeldakse' is the 3rd person singular present passive form of the verb 'öelda' (to say/speak). It's used when you want to express that something is generally or commonly said, without specifying who is saying it. This construction is very common in Estonian for expressing general statements or rumors."
