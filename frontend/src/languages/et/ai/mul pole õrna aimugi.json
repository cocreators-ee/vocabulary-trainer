  "context": "The phrase 'mul pole õrna aimugi' is an Estonian expression that literally translates to 'I don't have the faintest/least idea.' It's used when someone wants to express complete ignorance or lack of knowledge about something. The word 'õrna' means 'faint' or 'slight,' and 'aimugi' combines 'aimu' (idea/notion) with a diminutive suffix '-gi' meaning 'at all' or 'even.' This phrase emphasizes the speaker's total lack of information or understanding."
