It's a strong negation indicating complete lack of information or awareness. The word 'aimu' in Estonian can mean a faint idea, notion, or clue, and when combined with the negative construction 'pole õrna aimugi', it emphasizes total ignorance. This is commonly used in everyday conversation to express that someone has no information about a particular topic."
