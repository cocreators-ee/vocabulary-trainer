  "context": "In Estonian, 'tegu' is a noun that refers to a matter, affair, case, or business. It's often used in phrases like 'mis tegu on?' (what's the deal?) or 'meil on tegu kuskiga' (we have something/someone to deal with). The word can stand alone as 'the matter' or be part of compound expressions indicating what kind of situation or entity one is dealing with."
