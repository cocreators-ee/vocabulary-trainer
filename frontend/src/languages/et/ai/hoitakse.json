  "context": "The word 'hoitakse' is the 3rd person singular present tense passive form of the verb 'hoidma', which means to keep, preserve, maintain, or hold. In this passive construction (impersonal third-person), it indicates that something is being kept/preserved/maintained without specifying who is performing the action. The '-takse' ending is typical for Estonian passive verbs in present tense."
