It primarily means 'black' as in color, but can also refer to darkness without light (dark nights), being dirty or unclean (clothes becoming dirty), grim/dreary moods, and even illegal or disgraceful activities. Its form changes based on grammatical case - as shown with 'must' (nominative singular), 'mustad' (nominative plural), and 'mustaks' (translative case)."
