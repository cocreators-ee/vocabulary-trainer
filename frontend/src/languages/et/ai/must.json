  "context": "The word 'must' in Estonian is an adjective meaning 'black' or 'dark'. It's the basic form of the adjective (nominative singular masculine). In different grammatical contexts, it can change forms - for example, 'musta' is partitive case, 'must' in nominative plural remains the same, and 'muste' would be genitive/plural. The word describes color darkness or things that are black in color."
