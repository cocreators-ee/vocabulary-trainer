  "context": "The Estonian word 'mitte' is a negative particle that functions similarly to 'not' in English. It is used to negate verbs, adjectives, or other parts of speech. In Estonian grammar, it often appears before the verb it negates and can be combined with other particles like 'pole' (is not/are not). The word can also be used in various contexts including prohibitions ('mitte tee seda' - don't do that) and emphatic negation."
