  "context": "The word 'selliseid' is the partitive plural form of 'selline', meaning 'such' or 'this kind'. In Estonian, it's used to indicate examples of a category or specific items being discussed. When followed by nouns in the partitive case like 'antikehasid' (antibodies), it functions similarly to English expressions like 'such antibodies' or 'these kinds of antibodies'. The word is commonly used when referring to multiple examples of something that has been previously mentioned or understood from context."
