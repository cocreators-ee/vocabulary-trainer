  "context": "The word 'selliseid' is the plural partitive form of the demonstrative pronoun 'selline' in Estonian. It means 'such' or 'of such kind' and is used to indicate examples or types of things that have been mentioned previously. The '-d' ending indicates it's in the plural case, while the partitive case '-id' suffix shows we're talking about some or certain instances of these things without specifying exact quantity. It functions similarly to English words like 'such', 'like this', or 'of such kind'."
