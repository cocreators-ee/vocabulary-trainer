  "context": "The word 'said' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'saama'. It specifically appears as either the second-person singular past indicative ('you got/arrived') or the third-person plural past indicative ('they got/arrived'). The dictionary shows it's used in contexts about reaching a destination or arriving somewhere, and can also be used more figuratively to mean understanding something (getting the point)."
