  "context": "The word 'halva' appears to be the partitive singular form of the adjective 'halb' (bad/evil) in Estonian. The partitive case is often used when talking about qualities, states or characteristics of something. So 'halva' would mean 'of bad quality', 'in a bad way', or referring to something that is evil/wicked."
