  "context": "The Estonian word 'halva' is the genitive singular form of the adjective 'halb', meaning 'bad'. It is used to indicate possession or origin from something/someone that is bad. In this case, it would translate to 'of the bad one' or 'belonging to the bad person'. The dictionary examples show it being used in contexts where someone sees their supporters as 'augukaevaja' (diggers of graves) when downhearted, suggesting a negative connotation towards even those who support them."
