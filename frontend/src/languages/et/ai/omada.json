  "context": "The word 'omada' is the da-infinitive form of the Estonian verb 'omama', which means to have, to possess, or to own. It indicates possession or ownership of something. In Estonian grammar, the da-infinitive form is commonly used and can function similarly to English infinitives with 'to'. This word relates to having qualities, characteristics, or physical objects as one's own."
