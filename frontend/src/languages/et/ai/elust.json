  "context": "The word 'elust' is the elative case form of the Estonian noun 'elu', which means 'life'. The elative case in Estonian indicates motion away from something or origin from something. So 'elust' specifically means 'about life', 'of life', or 'from life' - indicating that something is coming from life, being discussed in relation to life, or originating from life."
