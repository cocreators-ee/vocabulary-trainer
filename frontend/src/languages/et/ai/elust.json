  "context": "The word 'elust' is the Estonian ablative case form of the noun 'elu', which means 'life'. The ablative case typically indicates movement away from, source, or origin. So 'elust' literally translates to 'from/about life' and is used when talking about something that comes from life, is related to life as a source, or describes aspects of someone's life story."
