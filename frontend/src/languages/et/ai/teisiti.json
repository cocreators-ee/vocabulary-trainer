  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'teisiti' means differently or in another way. It's formed from the root 'teine' (other/another) with the '-ti' suffix that transforms adjectives into adverbs of manner. This word is used to indicate that something is done, thought about, or perceived in a different manner than what was expected or usual."
