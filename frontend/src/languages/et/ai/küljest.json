  "context": "The Estonian word 'küljest' is a versatile postposition that indicates separation, removal, or being away from something. It can be used to show taking something off something else (like removing a hood from a coat), breaking off pieces (breaking a piece of bread), or releasing things from constraints (letting go). The word often appears in contexts where something is physically separated or detached from its original position or attachment point."
