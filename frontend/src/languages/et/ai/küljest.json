  "context": "The Estonian word 'küljest' is an adverb that means 'from beside' or 'from the side'. It indicates location or direction relative to something's side. This word comes from the root 'külg', which means 'side' in Estonian. The ending '-st' typically indicates the ablative case, showing source or origin - so 'küljest' literally means '(from) the side'. It's commonly used when describing movement away from a position beside something or when indicating someone is positioned next to something."
