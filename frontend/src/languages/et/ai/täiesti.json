  "context": "The word 'täiesti' is an Estonian adverb that means completely, totally, entirely, or absolutely. It's used to emphasize the totality or completeness of something. This word modifies adjectives and other adverbs to indicate a full degree or extent. For example, in 'Tema on täiesti eriline' (He/she is completely unique), it emphasizes the total uniqueness rather than just partial."
