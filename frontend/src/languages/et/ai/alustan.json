  "context": "The word 'alustan' is the 1st person singular present tense form of the verb 'alustama' which means 'to begin', 'to start', or 'to commence'. In Estonian, it specifically means 'I begin' or 'I start'. It's commonly used to introduce an action that follows immediately after a condition or another event is met. The word appears in contexts similar to English expressions like 'as soon as', 'when', or 'just when'. For example: 'Nagu ühed kindad valmis, alustan teisi' translates to 'As soon as one set of gloves is ready, I will begin the others'."
