  "context": "The Estonian word 'esile' is an adverb that means to bring something forward, into visibility or prominence. It can indicate bringing something out from hiding, making it apparent or visible (like bringing money from a pocket), drawing attention to someone or something (making them stand out from others), or highlighting/something coming to the forefront. The word has two main senses: 1) making something visible or apparent by bringing it out, and 2) putting something forward or into prominence, often in contrast to others."
