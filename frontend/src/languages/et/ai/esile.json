For example, in the first sentence it means bringing one's best qualities forward/out; in the second sentence it means highlighting something important; and in the third sentence it means taking someone's work particularly into prominence. The word is related to the verb 'esile tuua' which specifically means 'to bring forward' or 'to highlight'. It can be used in various contexts where you want to emphasize something or make it stand out from its surroundings."
