  "context": "The Estonian verb 'vastata' is the da-infinitive form of 'vastama', meaning to answer, reply or respond. It's used when someone responds to questions, calls, messages, or stimuli. In its dictionary definition context, it relates to physiological response to stimuli (excitability), but in everyday usage primarily means answering or responding verbally."
