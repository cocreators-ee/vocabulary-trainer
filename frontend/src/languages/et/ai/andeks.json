  "context": "The Estonian word 'andeks' is an adverb used with certain verbs like anda (to give), paluma (to ask for), and saama (to get). It primarily means forgiveness or pardon. In the context of asking for forgiveness, it functions similarly to saying 'forgive me' or 'pardon me' in English. When used with 'anna' (give) as in 'andke andeks' (give forgiveness), it's a request for someone to forgive you. The word can also be used more broadly as an apology or excuse me."
