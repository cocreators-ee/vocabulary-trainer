  "context": "The word 'kuulge' is the imperative (command) form of the Estonian verb 'kulgama', which means 'to listen' or 'to hear'. It's used when addressing someone directly to tell them to listen. The second person plural formal command form would be 'kuleke'. In addition to meaning 'listen/hear', it can also carry a sense of obedience or following instructions, similar to the English word 'obey' in some contexts."
