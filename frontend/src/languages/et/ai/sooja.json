  "context": "The Estonian word 'sooja' is an adjective that means 'warm' or 'hot'. It can be used to describe temperature, whether referring to the weather (warm/hot day), food (warm soup), or objects (warm home). In Estonian grammar, adjectives must agree in number and case with the noun they modify. The basic form 'sooja' is likely in the partitive singular case here."
