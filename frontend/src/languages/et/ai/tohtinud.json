  "context": "The word 'tohtinud' is the past tense of the Estonian verb 'toida', which means 'to allow' or 'to permit'. When used with the negation 'ei', it forms 'ei tohtinud', meaning 'was not allowed' or 'did not have permission'. This construction is commonly used in Estonian to express prohibition or lack of permission in the past tense. It's important to note that this appears in a dictionary entry for 'raudvara' where it's used as an example showing what a farmer was prohibited from doing."
