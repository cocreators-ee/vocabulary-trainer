  "context": "The word 'tohtinud' is the past participle form of the Estonian modal verb 'tõma', which means 'to allow' or 'to give permission'. As a past participle, it indicates an action that was allowed or had permission in the past. It's often used with auxiliary verbs to form perfect tenses, such as 'on tohtinud' (has been allowed) or 'oli tohtinud' (had been allowed). The word follows Estonian grammar rules for participles and is commonly used in formal and informal contexts when discussing permissions or allowances that occurred in the past."
