  "context": "The Estonian word 'püss' is a noun referring to a gun or firearm, specifically a rifle that can be either single-barreled or double-barreled. It's derived from Middle Low German 'busse'. The word follows specific declension patterns in Estonian with the genitive form being 'püssi' and partitive 'püssi'. In addition to its literal meaning of a firearm, it can also be used figuratively to describe something as 'sharp', 'intense', or 'fierce' (as in 'naine on tal äge, lausa päris püss' - the woman is sharp, almost like a real gun)."
