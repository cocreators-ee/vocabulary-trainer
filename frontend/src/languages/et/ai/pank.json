  "context": "The Estonian word 'pank' has multiple meanings. Primarily, it refers to a financial institution that performs monetary operations like credit, deposits, payments, and currency exchange - similar to banks in English. It can also refer to the physical building where this institution operates. In gambling contexts, 'pank' means a financial bet made at the start of a game or the money pot being played for. The word comes from Swedish/Low German 'bank'. Its grammatical forms include pank (nominative), panga (genitive), and panka (partitive)."
