  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'uhke' has multiple related meanings. It can mean someone who is proud and has a sense of their own worth or importance, often in a dignified way. This usage describes people with self-respect who don't tolerate being looked down upon. Alternatively, it can describe something as grand, lofty, magnificent, or splendid when referring to objects, places, or experiences. The word can be used for both positive dignified pride and sometimes more arrogant pride depending on context. It's an adjective that changes form in Estonian grammar - uhke (singular), uhked (plural), uhkem (comparative)."
