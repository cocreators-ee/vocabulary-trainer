  "context": "The word 'seni' is an Estonian adverb that indicates time up to a certain point. It's commonly used to refer to something that has happened or been the case until the present moment, similar to English expressions like 'so far', 'until now', or 'up to this point'. In sentences, it often appears at the beginning but can also be positioned elsewhere depending on emphasis and sentence structure."
