  "context": "The Estonian word 'jalgu' is the partitive case form of 'jalg', which means 'leg'. In this form, it typically appears in contexts where we're talking about legs but not as a complete subject or direct object - often after verbs that take objects in the partitive case (like having/taking something), when describing state/condition of legs, or with certain prepositions. The word can refer to human legs or animal limbs."
