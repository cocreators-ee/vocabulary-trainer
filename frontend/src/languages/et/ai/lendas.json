  "context": "Lendas is the third-person singular past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'lendama', which means 'to fly' or 'to travel by air'. It specifically refers to someone flying in the past tense. The word appears in a folk tradition context where throwing a scythe and seeing whose travels farthest was used for fortune-telling about who would marry first."
