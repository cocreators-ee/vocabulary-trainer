  "context": "The Estonian word 'idee' comes from French and Latin, meaning a sudden inventive thought or intention. It can refer to a plan or concept (like in 'päästev idee' - saving idea), an essential principle or main thought (in philosophical contexts), or even philosophical concepts as in Plato's philosophy. The word follows regular Estonian declension patterns with forms like 'ideed' (genitive/partitive) and 'ideede' (plural genitive)."
