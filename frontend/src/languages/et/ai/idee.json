  "context": "The Estonian word 'idee' is a feminine noun that directly corresponds to the English words 'idea', 'thought', or 'concept'. It's used in everyday language to refer to thoughts, suggestions, or mental concepts. Like in many languages, it follows Estonian grammatical rules for case declension and can appear in different forms depending on its role in a sentence (e.g., 'ideed' in the partitive case)."
