It can be used in many contexts: leaving something somewhere (Jätsin vihmavarju rongi - I left the umbrella on the train), putting something in a particular state or position (Olen prillid koju jätnud - I've left my glasses at home), abandoning someone in trouble (Sõpra ei tohi hätta jätta - One must not abandon a friend in difficulty), leaving something for a specific purpose (Üks leib tuleb varuks jätta - We need to leave one loaf as reserve), or quitting something entirely. It's also used in expressions of farewell (Jätsime hüvasti - We said goodbye). The verb can indicate causing something to be in a particular state, putting someone in a position, or abandoning an activity."
