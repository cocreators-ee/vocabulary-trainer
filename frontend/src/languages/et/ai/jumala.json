  "context": "The Estonian word 'jumala' is an adverb used colloquially and in slang to express emphasis, meaning 'very', 'really', or 'completely'. It functions as an intensifier to modify adjectives or other parts of speech to indicate a high degree. While it shares the same spelling as the genitive singular form of 'jumal' (meaning 'god'), when used as an adverb in this context, it's functioning as an intensifier rather than referring to deity."
