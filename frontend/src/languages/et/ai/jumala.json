  "context": "The word 'jumala' is the Estonian word for 'God'. It can be used to refer to God in general, or as a common noun meaning divine being. In its basic form 'jumal', it means 'God', but when declined with suffixes like '-a', it becomes part of phrases indicating possession, quality, or relation to the divine."
