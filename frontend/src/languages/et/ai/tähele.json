  "context": "The word 'tähele' is an Estonian adverb that forms a phrasal verb with 'panema' (to put), creating the phrase 'tähele panema' which means 'to pay attention'. It comes from the allative case of 'täht' (star/letter). As a standalone word, it's used in constructions where someone is being told to notice or observe something. The word can appear before nouns to indicate paying attention to them, as seen in the first example sentence."
