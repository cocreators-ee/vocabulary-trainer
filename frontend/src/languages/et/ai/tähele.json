  "context": "The Estonian word 'tähele' is the partitive form of 'tähelepanek' (attention) and is used in the expression 'tähele panema' which means 'to notice' or 'to pay attention to'. It's commonly followed by the verb 'panema' (to put/place). This construction indicates directing one's attention toward something specific. The word can also be used reflexively as 'tähele panna' meaning 'to cause someone to notice'."
