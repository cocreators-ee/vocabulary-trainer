  "context": "The word 'laupäeval' is an Estonian adverbial form meaning 'on Saturday' or 'during the day of Saturday'. It indicates when something happens - specifically on Saturdays. This is in the adessive case, which typically means location/position or time in Estonian. The base noun is 'laupäev' (Saturday), and the '-l' ending makes it an adverbial expression of time."
