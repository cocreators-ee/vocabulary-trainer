  "context": "The Estonian word 'hakka' is a verb that means 'to begin', 'to start', or 'to commence'. It's commonly used to indicate the initiation of an action or process. In the first person singular form it becomes 'hakan', in first person plural 'hakkame', and when conjugated with third person subjects it takes '-b' as in ' hakkab'. This verb often appears with the particle 'juba' (already) or temporal adverbs to indicate when something starts."
