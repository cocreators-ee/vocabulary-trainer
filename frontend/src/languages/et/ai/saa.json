  "context": "The Estonian word 'saa' is a verb that can have multiple meanings depending on context. It appears to be in different forms: as an imperative form meaning 'let [someone] go' or '[someone] may go', and as a past tense form meaning '[subject] got/received'. The exact interpretation depends heavily on the grammatical person, tense, and context of use."
