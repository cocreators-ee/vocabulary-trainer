  "context": "The word 'saa' in this context is part of the phrase 'ei saa otsa ega aru', which means someone cannot make sense of something or cannot understand it properly. It's often used when a person is confused about information they've received and can't comprehend the beginning (otsa) or the meaning (aru). This appears to be a colloquial expression in Estonian indicating confusion or inability to comprehend something."
