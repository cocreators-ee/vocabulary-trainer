  "context": "The Estonian word 'kelle' is a question pronoun that means 'whose' or is used in questions about possession or association. It's the genitive case form of the interrogative pronoun 'kes' (who/whom). When asking 'kelle see on?', you're asking 'Whose is this?'. This word follows Estonian grammar rules where question words change form depending on their grammatical function in the sentence."
