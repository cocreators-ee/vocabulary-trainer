  "context": "'Ajud' is the plural form of 'aju', which in Estonian can refer to several related concepts: 1) The speed or manner of movement, particularly galloping or running as with horses; 2) A hunt or pursuit (like a fox hunt); 3) Driven by forces like wind or waves. In this case as 'ajud' (plural), it would refer to multiple instances of such movements, hunts, or force-driven actions."
