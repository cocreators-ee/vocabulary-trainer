  "context": "The word 'ajud' is the partitive form of 'aja', which refers to a high mountain or peak in Estonian. In this case, it appears to be used as a proper noun referring to a specific mountain called Ajud. The partitive case suggests it might be used with verbs that require this grammatical case, such as describing the mountain's characteristics or actions performed on/with it."
