  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'praegu' means 'now', 'at the moment', or 'currently'. It indicates something happening in the present time period. The word is formed from Proto-Finnic roots meaning literally 'the suitable time'. It's commonly used to refer to the current point in time when speaking or writing, similar to how English speakers use 'now'."
