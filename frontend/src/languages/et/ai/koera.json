  "context": "The word 'koera' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'koer', which means 'dog'. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case often indicates possession or association. So 'koera' can mean 'of a dog', 'belonging to a dog', or simply be used in contexts where the genitive case is required by grammatical rules. It's commonly seen in phrases like 'koera otsin' (I'm looking for a dog) or when referring to something that belongs to a dog."
