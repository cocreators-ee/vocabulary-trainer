  "context": "The Estonian word 'nendes' is an inessive case form of the demonstrative pronoun 'need', which means 'those'. It indicates location within or among something, functioning as a postposition that shows where something is located. The -des ending indicates the inessive case, meaning 'in' or 'among'. This word is used to show spatial relationships and specify exactly where things are positioned."
