  "context": "The Estonian word 'viisin' is the third person singular form of the verb 'viiama/viima', meaning to take or bring. In this context, it appears to be part of the compound construction 'viisida klaasida' (to glaze/put glass in), where 'klaasida' means to put glass in something. So 'viisin pildi klaasida' would mean 'I put glass in the picture/frame'. This is a specialized usage related to glazing or covering with glass, commonly used for windows, frames, and other items that need transparent covers."
