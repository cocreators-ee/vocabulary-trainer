  "context": "In Estonian, 'püsi' refers to the quality of being able to remain in one place or continue with an activity for a sustained period. It can mean persistence in continuing something, endurance in maintaining position or state, or patience in waiting without moving. The word is often used when someone lacks this quality - when they can't stay put long enough or don't have the endurance to complete activities."
