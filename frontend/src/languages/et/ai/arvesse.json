  "context": "The Estonian word 'arvesse' is the illative case form of 'arv', which means 'number'. It indicates movement toward or inclusion in something. In usage, it typically means that something has been taken into account, recorded, included, or counted as part of a whole system. This grammatical construction shows directionality - going into the state of being accounted for."
