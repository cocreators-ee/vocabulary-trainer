  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuskilt' is an adverb that indicates something or someone comes from an unspecified, indeterminate location. It's used in affirmative sentences to mean 'from somewhere' when the exact origin is not known or specified. In negative sentences, it becomes 'not from anywhere'. The word can also refer to time meaning 'from some unspecified period'. It's formed from 'kuskil' (somewhere) with the '-t' suffix indicating direction away from a location."
