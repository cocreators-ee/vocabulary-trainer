  "context": "The Estonian word 'täht' is versatile with multiple meanings. Primarily, it means 'star' as a celestial object like in astronomy. It also refers to famous people or celebrities ('staar'), letters of the alphabet, and various marks or signs. The meaning depends heavily on context - astronomical contexts refer to actual stars in space, entertainment contexts refer to famous performers, educational contexts relate to written characters, and symbolic contexts refer to marks or indicators."
