  "context": "The word 'mütsi' is the partitive case form of 'müts', which means 'hat' or 'cap' in English. In Estonian, the partitive case often indicates an incomplete action or object, but here it's likely used as a specific instance or type of hat. The base word 'müts' refers to any head covering that is typically worn for warmth or fashion."
