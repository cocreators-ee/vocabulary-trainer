  "context": "The word 'võetakse' is the 3rd person singular/plural present passive form of the Estonian verb 'võtma'. It means 'to take', and in this form it indicates that something is being taken or received, typically without specifying who is doing the taking. This construction is commonly used when the agent (the one performing the action) is unknown, unimportant, or obvious from context."
