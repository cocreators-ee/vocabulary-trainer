  "context": "The word 'tantsu' in this context appears to be a form of Estonian related to dance or dancing, used specifically in the phrase 'big bänd tantsu muusik' which translates to 'big band dance music'. It refers to music that is specifically composed and arranged for dancing, particularly associated with big bands and swing jazz genres. The word likely comes from the Estonian verb 'tantsima' (to dance) in either the genitive case or part of a compound term."
