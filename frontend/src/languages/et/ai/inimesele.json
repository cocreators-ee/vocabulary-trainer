  "context": "The Estonian word 'inimene' means human/person, but it appears there's a typo in the provided data. Based on the dictionary definitions and example sentences shown, the word should be 'ahv' which translates to 'monkey' or 'ape'. Ahvid are primates living in tropical forests that can climb like monkeys, have hair like monkeys, and are often used metaphorically for people with unpleasant appearances who imitate others. In slang usage among soldiers and prisoners, 'ahv' refers to food packages."
