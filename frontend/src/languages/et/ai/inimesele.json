  "context": "The word 'inimesele' is the allative case form of 'inimene', which means 'person' or 'human being'. In Estonian, the allative case (-le ending) indicates motion toward or direction to someone or something. So 'inimesele' specifically means 'to a person' or 'for a person', indicating that something is directed towards or intended for a human being. It's used when showing movement towards or giving something to a person."
