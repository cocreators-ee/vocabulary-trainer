  "context": "The word 'uksele' in Estonian is a directional adverb or postposition that indicates movement toward a door. It's derived from the partitive case of 'uks' (door), meaning 'toward the door'. This form typically follows the verb of action and specifies that the action is directed at a door. In this context, it's commonly used with verbs like 'põruda' (to knock/pound) to indicate someone is knocking on a door."
