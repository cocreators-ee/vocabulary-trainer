  "context": "The word 'joome' is an Estonian verb form meaning 'let us drink' or 'drink all'. It comes from the root 'jooma' (to drink) and appears to be used as a drinking toast or instruction to finish one's drink. The dictionary entry shows it specifically relates to drinking until the bottom of the glass ('põhjani'), similar to English expressions like 'bottoms up'."
