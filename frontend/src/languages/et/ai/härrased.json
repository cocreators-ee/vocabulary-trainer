  "context": "The word 'härrased' is the plural form of 'härra' and has two main meanings: 1) Refers to wealthy, privileged upper-class families or gentlemen, often from German descent in historical context; 2) Used as a polite form of address when speaking to multiple men or mixed groups. In historical contexts, it specifically denotes nobility or the gentry class, while in modern usage it's more commonly used as a respectful term addressing gentlemen."
