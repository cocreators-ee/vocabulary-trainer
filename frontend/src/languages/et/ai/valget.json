  "context": "The Estonian phrase 'musta ega valget' is an idiom that means 'neither black nor white'. It's used when someone refuses to talk about something or remains completely silent on a topic. The expression literally refers to not speaking words associated with colors (black and white) but has evolved to mean saying nothing at all about a particular subject."
