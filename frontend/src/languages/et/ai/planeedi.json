  "context": "The word 'planeedi' in Estonian refers to a planet, which is a celestial body that orbits around a star. In Estonian grammar, this would be in the partitive case when used with verbs like 'näha' (to see) or as an object. The singular form would be 'planeet', and 'planeeti' appears to be in some oblique case form. Planets are significant objects in astronomy and often studied for their characteristics, orbits, and potential for life."
