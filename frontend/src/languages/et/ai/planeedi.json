  "context": "Afeel is an Estonian astronomical term that refers to aphelion, which is the point in a planet's orbit when it is farthest from the Sun. This occurs because planetary orbits are elliptical rather than perfectly circular. The word 'afeel' specifically describes this orbital position and is commonly used in astronomy contexts when discussing planetary motion."
