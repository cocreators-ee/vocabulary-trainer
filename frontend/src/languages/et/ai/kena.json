  "context": "The Estonian word 'kena' is a versatile adjective with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'pretty' or 'attractive' when describing appearance (like in the sentence about a boy being 'kena'), 'nice' or 'kind' when referring to people's behavior, and 'pleasant', 'good', or 'decent' when describing situations, weather, or things. The comparative form is 'kenam' (nicer/prettier) and the superlative is 'kõige kenam' (the nicest/prettiest). It can also be used colloquially to mean 'quite large' or 'considerable', though this usage is less common."
