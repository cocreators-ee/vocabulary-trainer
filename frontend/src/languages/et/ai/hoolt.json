  "context": "The Estonian word 'eest' is a versatile postposition that primarily means 'for' or 'in behalf of'. It's used to indicate purpose, benefit, representation, or causation. When combined with verbs like 'hoolitsema' (to care for), it shows what someone is caring about or taking responsibility for. In the context of 'hoolt', it forms the phrase 'hoolt eest' which means 'to take care for'. The word can appear in various constructions showing whose behalf something is done, what's being cared for, or the reason/purpose behind an action."
