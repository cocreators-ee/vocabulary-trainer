The word can refer to any type of building - houses, office buildings, schools, etc. In the examples: 1) 'See on uus hoone' means 'This is a new building.' 2) 'Meie koolis on palju hoonet' shows the partitive case ('hoonet') meaning 'There are many buildings in our school.' 3) 'Hooned linna keskel on v채ga k천rged' uses the plural form ('hooned') to mean 'Buildings in the city center are very tall.'"
