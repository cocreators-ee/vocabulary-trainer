  "context": "The Estonian word 'toimib' is the 3rd person singular present form of the verb 'tööma', meaning 'to work', 'to function', or 'to operate'. In this context, it describes how someone behaves or acts in a certain way. From the dictionary entry for 'hull', we can see that when describing people who are acting abnormally or irrationally (like 'hull' - crazy), their behavior is described as 'toimib rumalasti' (acts foolishly) or similar constructions showing abnormal functioning or behavior."
