  "context": "\"Sinuga\" is the comitative case form of the Estonian pronoun \"sina\" (you). It means \"with you\" or \"together with you\" and indicates accompaniment or association. This form is used when something is done along with someone, similar to saying \"come with me\" in English. The word appears to be commonly used in informal expressions, as shown in the dictionary examples where it's often paired with interjections like \"pagan\" (meaning \"let them\" or \"never mind\")."
