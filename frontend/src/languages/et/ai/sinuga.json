  "context": "The word 'sinuga' is a combination of the Estonian pronoun 'sina' (you) and the instrumental case suffix '-ga', which means 'with'. It functions as an adverbial phrase indicating accompaniment or association. The form shows it's in the instrumental case, specifically with the pronoun 'sina' (singular you). In Estonian grammar, this ending is added to nouns and pronouns when they are used as instruments or means, but here it primarily indicates being together with someone."
