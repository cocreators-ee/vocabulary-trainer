  "context": "The Estonian word 'tulevikust' is an elative case form of the noun 'tulevik', which means 'future'. The '-st' ending indicates that it's in the elative case, meaning 'from' or 'out of'. So 'tulevikust' specifically means 'from the future' or 'out of the future'. This form is used when something comes from the future perspective."
