  "context": "The word 'igast' is an Estonian adverb meaning 'from all sides' or 'in every direction.' It indicates something that encompasses every possible direction or perspective. In the dictionary definition, it's listed as being related to 'ava|lohk geogr mitte' (open depression not geographical), suggesting it relates to areas that are open or surrounded but not in a geographical context. The word is commonly used to describe locations that are completely accessible from every angle, such as places surrounded by something visible from all directions."
