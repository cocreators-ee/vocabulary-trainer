  "context": "The word 'kirikus' in Estonian is used as an intensifier to express certainty or completeness. It derives from the phrase 'nagu aamen kirikus' (like amen in church), which signifies something that is unquestionably true or definite, just as 'amen' said in church represents absolute affirmation of truth."
