  "context": "The Estonian word 'keha' has multiple meanings. Most commonly, it refers to the human or animal body (as in 'Lapse kleenuke keha' - The child's clean clothes on his body). It can also refer to physical objects or substances that occupy space (as in physics contexts), and as a compound element meaning 'main part' of something. In colloquial usage, it's often used to describe the physical appearance or build of a person."
