  "context": "The Estonian word 'kurjus' is a noun that refers to evil, wickedness, or malicious behavior. It comes from the adjective 'kuri' (evil) and has the suffix '-us' which typically forms abstract nouns in Estonian. The word can refer to both the quality of being evil and evil acts or things themselves. In the dictionary examples, it's used to describe someone's evil nature ('selle inimese kurjus'), a heart full of wickedness ('kurjust täis'), and what someone might have done in their wickedness ('oma kurjuses')."
