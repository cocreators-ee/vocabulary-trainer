  "context": "The Estonian word 'ilusti' is an adverb that describes actions done in a pleasant, agreeable or well-mannered way. It can indicate politeness in speech, good behavior, or the quality of something being done nicely or well. The word comes from the adjective 'iline' (pleasant) and the adverb-forming suffix '-sti', making it an Estonian equivalent to English words like 'nicely', 'politely', or 'well-behaved'. In usage, it often describes positive social behavior, pleasant mannerisms, or actions performed with care and consideration."
