  "context": "In Estonian, 'vee' is the genitive case form of 'vesi', which means 'water'. The genitive case in Estonian indicates possession or relationship, similar to English possessive forms like 'of water' or constructions indicating origin/material. For example, 'vee' would be used when something belongs to, comes from, or is made of water."
