  "context": "In Estonian, 'valu' primarily means pain or ache in the physical sense. It refers to uncomfortable sensations in the body that can be caused by injury, illness, or tissue damage. The word is widely used to describe various types of physical discomfort including headaches, stomachaches, joint pain, and other bodily pains. Beyond its primary meaning, 'valu' also has extended meanings: it can refer to emotional suffering or distress (like heartache), intense desire or strong will, metaphorically as hardship or struggle, and in some contexts even refers to a casting procedure in metallurgy."
