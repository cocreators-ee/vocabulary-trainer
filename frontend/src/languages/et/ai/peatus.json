  "context": "In Estonian, 'peatus' is a versatile word that can refer to: 1) an act of stopping or pausing (like making a stop during travel), 2) the location where one stops (such as a bus stop, tram stop, etc.), or 3) in some contexts, a resting place. It's derived from 'peatama' meaning to stop. The word can be used both for temporary pauses and permanent stopping places. Related compound words include 'bussipeatus' (bus stop), 'trammi peatus' (tram stop), and 'raudteepeatus' (train station)."
