  "context": "Millest is the elative singular form of the Estonian interrogative pronoun 'mis' (what). It functions as an adverbial phrase meaning 'from what', 'of what', or 'where from'. The elative case indicates movement away from something, so millest specifically asks about origin or source. For example: 'Millest sa tead seda?' means 'From what do you know this?', and 'Millest need asjad pärit on?' means 'Where from are these things derived?'"
