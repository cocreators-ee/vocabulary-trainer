  "context": "The Estonian verb 'laskma' is used to express permission, allowance, or the act of letting someone do something. It can be translated as 'to let', 'to allow', or 'to permit'. This verb takes an indirect object (the person being allowed) and a direct object (the action being permitted). For example, in 'Laskme meie lapse minema' we're saying 'Let our child go' where the child is being allowed to leave. In its different forms, it can express past permission ('Ta laskis endale uue auto osta' - He let himself buy a new car) or first person perspective ('Lasksin sellel teel olla' - I let him be on that road)."
