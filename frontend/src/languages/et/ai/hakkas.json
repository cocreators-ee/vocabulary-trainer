  "context": "The word 'hakkas' is the third-person singular past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'hakkama'. It means 'began', 'started', or 'commenced' and indicates that someone (third person) started doing something in the past. In English, this would translate to 'he/she/it began' or 'he/she/it started'. For example, if you say 'Ta hakkas kooli,' it means 'He/she began school.' The verb implies the initiation of an action without specifying completion."
