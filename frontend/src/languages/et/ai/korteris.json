  "context": "The Estonian word 'korteris' is an inessive case form of the noun 'korteri', meaning 'apartment' or 'flat'. The '-is' ending indicates location inside something, so 'korteris' specifically means 'in the apartment/flat'. This is commonly used to indicate where someone lives or the location of activities happening indoors within a residential unit."
