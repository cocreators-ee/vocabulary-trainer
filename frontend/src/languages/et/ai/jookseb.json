  "context": "The word 'jookseb' in this context is a form of the verb 'jooksma' (to run), but here it has an idiomatic meaning. When used with 'juhe' (thread, string) as in 'juhe jooksis', it means that threads or strands became tangled, mixed up, or confused. This can be used literally for physical threads getting entangled, or metaphorically when thoughts, plans, or situations become disorganized and confusing."
