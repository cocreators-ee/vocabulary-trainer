  "context": "The Estonian word 'haiglas' is an inessive case form of the noun 'haigla', meaning 'hospital'. The '-s' ending indicates location within something, so it translates to 'in hospital' or 'at the hospital'. This is the standard way to express being located inside a hospital building in Estonian."
