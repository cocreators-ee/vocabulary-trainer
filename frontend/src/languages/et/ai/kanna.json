  "context": "The word 'kanna' is the 3rd person singular form of the Estonian verb 'kandma', meaning to carry, to wear, or to bear. It can refer to physically carrying something (like groceries), wearing clothing (like a dress), or bearing responsibility/emotions. The dictionary definition shows it's also used as the illative singular form of 'kana' (chicken/bird) in some contexts, but the primary meaning is the verb conjugation."
