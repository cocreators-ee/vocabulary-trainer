  "context": "The word 'pannud' appears to be part of the compound term 'kuriteopanija' which means someone who commits a criminal act or offense. In Estonian, 'pandud' is the past participle form of 'panema' (to put/do), so it refers to someone who has done or committed something specific - in this case, a crime. The dictionary definitions show that 'kurjategija' specifically means a person who commits crimes, offenses, or wrongdoings."
