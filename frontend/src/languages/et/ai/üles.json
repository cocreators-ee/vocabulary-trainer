  "context": "The Estonian word 'üles' is primarily an adverb that indicates movement from a lower position to a higher position, or upward direction. It can refer to physical movement (climbing stairs), transition from lying/sitting to standing, ending of an action (like snow melting), waking up from sleep, or even metaphorical increases in prices or status. The word has multiple nuanced meanings depending on context - it's one of the most versatile Estonian words with over 20 different uses including physical movement, completion of actions, waking up, and figurative increases."
