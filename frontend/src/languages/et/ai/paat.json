  "context": "The Estonian word 'paat' primarily means a small, open craft usually for inshore riding and competing in aquatic sports. It can refer to various types of boats including rowboats, motorboats, sailboats, etc. The word comes from Proto-Norse and is cognate with similar words in Finnish, Ingrian, and Votic. In Estonian grammar, 'paat' declines as follows: genitive singular 'paadi', partitive singular 'paati', nominative plural 'paadid'."
