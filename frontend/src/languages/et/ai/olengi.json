  "context": "The word 'olengi' is an Estonian verb form that combines the auxiliary verb 'olema' (to be) with the conditional mood suffix '-gi'. It typically appears in compound past tenses, often expressing a hypothetical or counterfactual situation where someone was somewhere or had been somewhere. The '-gi' particle adds emphasis and can sometimes indicate contrast or addition to what was previously mentioned."
