  "context": "The Estonian verb 'mõtlema' primarily means to engage in the process of thinking - considering, reflecting, and making judgments. It can also mean to intend or plan something. The word comes from Proto-Germanic origins and is cognate with similar words in other Finno-Ugric languages. In Estonian, it's used in various contexts including mental activity (thinking about problems), forming opinions, planning future actions, and imagining things. The verb has two possible weak grade forms: either the '-t-' is dropped or preserved in conjugation."
