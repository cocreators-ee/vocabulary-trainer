  "context": "The Estonian word 'tundmatu' is an adjective that means 'unknown', 'unfamiliar', or 'strange'. It can also function as a noun referring to a stranger. In mathematics, it refers to unknown variables in equations. The word derives from the verb 'tundma' (to know) with the negation suffix '-matu' meaning 'not able to be known'. Examples show its usage for describing unknown voices, unfamiliar places, mysterious illnesses, as well as referring to strangers or people who want to remain anonymous."
