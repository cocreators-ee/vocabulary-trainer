It is formed from the root word 'tundma' (to know/recognize) with the negative suffix '-tu', indicating something that cannot be recognized or is not known. The adjective can be used to describe people, places, things, or situations that are unfamiliar to someone. When referring to a person, it means 'unknown person'."
