  "context": "The word 'toimus' is the past tense third person singular form of the Estonian verb 'tulema', which means 'to take place', 'to happen', or 'to occur'. It describes an event that has already happened in the past. In the examples, it shows various contexts where events occurred - a concert taking place at 8 o'clock, work finishing as planned, and people not knowing about a meeting happening the next day."
