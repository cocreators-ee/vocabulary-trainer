  "context": "The word 'aita' is an Estonian verb that means 'to help' or 'to assist'. It's the present indicative connegative form of the verb 'aitama' and also the second-person singular imperative form. In the example sentence 'Ei aita enam ussirohi ega püssirohi', it shows negative usage meaning 'doesn't help anymore' - literally referring to gunpowder or snake root not helping in desperate situations, indicating that nothing helps when things are really bad."
