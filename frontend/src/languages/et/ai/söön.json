  "context": "The word 'söön' is the first person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'sööma', which means 'to eat'. It is used when referring to oneself eating in the present moment. In Estonian, verbs conjugate according to person and number, so 'söön' specifically means 'I eat' as opposed to other forms like 'sa sööd' (you eat) or 'ta sööb' (he/she eats)."
