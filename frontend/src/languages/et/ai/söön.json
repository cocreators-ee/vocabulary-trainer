  "context": "The word 'söön' appears to be a typo or misrepresentation in the dictionary definition. The correct form shown is actually 'küpselt', which means 'maturely' or 'ripe'. It's an adverb describing something that has reached full maturity or development, used when referring to plans that are well-considered or things that have ripened fully."
