  "context": "The Estonian verb 'tantsima' means 'to dance'. It refers to moving rhythmically to music, either alone or with a partner according to specific rules. This word can be used for both people dancing (as in social dancing) and metaphorical uses where objects or phenomena seem to move in a dance-like manner. The infinitive form is 'tantsima', while the da-infinitive form is 'tantsida'. It's derived from Middle Low German 'dansen'/'danzen'."
