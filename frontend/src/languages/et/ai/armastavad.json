  "context": "The word 'armastavad' is the 3rd person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'armastama', which means 'to love'. It translates to English as 'love' when referring to multiple subjects (they/we). This word expresses deep affection and care for someone or something. In Estonian, verbs are conjugated based on person and number, so this form specifically indicates that a group of people is performing the action of loving."
