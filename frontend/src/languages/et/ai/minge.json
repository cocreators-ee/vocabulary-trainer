  "context": "Minge is an Estonian expression used in colloquial speech as a dismissive or permissive phrase. It's often used to tell someone to proceed with something despite lack of justification, or can be used sarcastically to express exasperation or dismissal. From the examples provided by O. Luts and L. Hainsalu, we can see it's used in contexts where someone is being told to just go ahead and do something without further explanation."
