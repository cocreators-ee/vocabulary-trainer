  "context": "The Estonian word 'hullud' is the plural form of 'hull', which functions as both an adjective and a noun. As an adjective, it means 'crazy,' 'mad,' 'insane,' or can describe something as wild, foolish, or terrible in intensity. As a noun (plural), it refers to crazy people. The word has multiple nuances including describing mentally ill individuals, extreme emotional states, very bad situations, and is sometimes used colloquially as a mild curse term. Comparative form 'hullem' means 'worse,' and superlative 'kõige hullem' means 'worst.'"
