  "context": "The Estonian verb 'viima' is used to express the action of leading, bringing, conducting or carrying something/someone from one place to another. It can be used both for physical movement (like taking someone somewhere) and abstract concepts (carrying out a plan). The word changes form depending on tense and person - 'viin', 'viid', 'viib', etc. It's derived from Proto-Finnic *veedäk."
