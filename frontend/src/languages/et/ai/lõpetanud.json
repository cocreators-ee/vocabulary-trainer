  "context": "The word 'lõpetanud' is the past participle form of the verb 'lõpetama', which means 'to finish' or 'to complete'. In this context, it specifically refers to having completed one's education, particularly at a university level. The dictionary definition mentions that in some countries (like tsarist Russia), it was used as a scientific degree awarded to someone who had defended their candidate's thesis. Currently, it most commonly means 'graduated' from an educational institution."
