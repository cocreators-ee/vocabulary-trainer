  "context": "The Estonian word 'istuge' is the second person plural imperative form of the verb 'istuma' (to sit). It's used when telling a group of people to sit down or take seats. The dictionary definition shows it can also relate to anchoring ships ('ahtrit ankrusse panema'), but this appears to be a specific nautical usage that combines sitting with ship commands."
