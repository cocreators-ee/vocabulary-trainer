  "context": "The word 'poissi' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'poiss', which means 'boy'. The partitive case in Estonian is used to indicate partialness, indefiniteness, or object status. In this form, it would typically be used as the direct object of a verb or to express an incomplete action. For example, 'Nägin poissi' means 'I saw (a) boy', where the partitive indicates that we're talking about some unspecified boy."
