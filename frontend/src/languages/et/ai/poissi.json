  "context": "In Estonian, 'poissi' is the partitive form of 'poiss,' which means 'boy' or 'boys.' The partitive case in Estonian is used to indicate partiality, indefiniteness, or to specify an object of an action. In this context, it would be translated as 'a boy' or 'some boys' depending on the sentence structure. It's often seen after verbs that imply eating, drinking, doing something partially, or when referring to an unspecified number of objects."
