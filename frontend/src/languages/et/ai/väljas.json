  "context": "The Estonian word 'väljas' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean physical location (out, outside), away from a place (away from home), released or available (gripp on juba väljas = flu is already out/released), or present/at work. It's the inessive singular form of 'väli' but functions primarily as an adverb meaning 'out' or 'outside'. The word can also indicate being away from a specific situation, condition, or location."
