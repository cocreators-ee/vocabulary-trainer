  "context": "The Estonian word 'kordi' is part of the root 'kord-' which relates to repetition, frequency, or occurrence. It's an adverbial form that can mean 'several times,' 'again,' or depending on context 'once.' When used with 'küsimas' (asking) it means repeatedly asking; when used before returning, it implies coming back again; and when used with time references like 'aastas' (in a year), it indicates frequency of occurrence once per year. The word is versatile in expressing both multiplicity and repetition."
