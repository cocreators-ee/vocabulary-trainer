  "context": "The Estonian verb 'nutma' means to cry or weep, typically expressing strong negative emotions like sorrow, pain, anger, or sometimes even joy. It can refer to shedding tears (crying), making a sad sound (whimpering), or being covered in drops/dew. The word has onomatopoeic origins and appears in various contexts including emotional expression (children crying from sadness, mothers crying for sons gone to war) and literal descriptions of sounds made by wind in chimneys or tears rolling down faces."
