  "context": "The word 'maetud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'maetama', which means 'to bury'. It describes something that has been buried or interred. This can refer to a person who has been buried in a cemetery, or metaphorically to something that has been covered or embedded in something else, such as cold being 'buried' in a room."
