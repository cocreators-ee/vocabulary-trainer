  "context": "The word 'maetud' is the past participle of the Estonian verb 'maama', which means 'to bury'. It describes something that has been buried or interred. In the example sentences, it seems to be used metaphorically - suggesting a dog is 'buried' here (literally) and that this explains something about the situation."
