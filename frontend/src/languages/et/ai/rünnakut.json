  "context": "The word 'rünnakut' is the partitive case form of 'rünnak', which means 'attack'. In Estonian, the partitive case (-t ending) is used to indicate an incomplete action or the object being acted upon. So 'rünnakut' specifically refers to 'an attack' or 'attacks' as the direct object of a verb. It's commonly used in military contexts but can also refer to verbal attacks or other forms of aggression."
