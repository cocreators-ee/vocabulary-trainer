  "context": "The Estonian word 'poe' is the partitive form of the noun 'pood', which means store or shop. It's used when referring to a store in a general sense or when talking about going to, being at, or doing something related to stores. The partitive case often indicates partialness or indefiniteness, so here it can mean '(a) store' or generally about the concept of shopping."
