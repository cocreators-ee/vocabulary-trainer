  "context": "The word 'tundur' in Estonian refers to a treeless Arctic region or tundra, characterized by low-growing vegetation like mosses, lichens, and small shrubs that can survive the cold climate. It's commonly used in geographical contexts to describe these vast, open landscapes found in northern regions where trees cannot grow due to permafrost and harsh conditions."
