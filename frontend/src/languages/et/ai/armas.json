  "context": "In Estonian, 'armas' is an adjective with multiple related meanings. It can mean 'dear' or 'beloved' when used to describe people or things you care about (like family members). It also means 'cute,' 'sweet,' or 'pleasant' when describing something endearing or agreeable. The word changes form depending on case and number - for example, the genitive singular is 'armsa,' plural nominative is 'armsad,' and partitive can be either 'armsat' or 'armast.' It's commonly used in both literal expressions of affection and as a polite introductory phrase when addressing someone."
