  "context": "The Estonian word 'vali' is an adjective with multiple meanings depending on context. It can describe sounds that are loud and far-reaching (like a voice), weather conditions that are harsh or severe (like a strong wind), people who are stern or unfeeling, things that have a strong effect, or characteristics that are notable or excellent. The word carries connotations of intensity - whether it's the volume of sound, the severity of weather, the strictness of person, or the strength of impact."
