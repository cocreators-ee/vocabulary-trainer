  "context": "The word 'inimeste' is the partitive plural form of 'inimene', meaning 'person'. In Estonian, the partitive case is often used to indicate partiality or indefiniteness. So 'inimeste' can mean '(of) people' or '(some) people'. It's commonly used when referring to people in a general sense or when you don't want to specify an exact number."
