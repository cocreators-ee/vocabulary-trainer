  "context": "The Estonian word 'ütlete' is a form of the verb 'panema' (to put/place) used in specific contexts where something or someone is being moved to their proper or designated position. It appears to be related to the concept of placing things in their correct location, as seen in the dictionary definition which shows it's an adverbial form indicating movement from a stationary position. The word often implies putting something back where it belongs or establishing things in order."
