  "context": "The Estonian word 'läbi' is a versatile preposition or adverb that indicates movement through something, completion of an action, or passage of time. It can mean 'through', 'across', 'by', 'past', or 'throughout' depending on the context. When used with motion verbs like jooksma (to run), it means moving through a space. With completion contexts, it indicates finishing something completely. When referring to time periods, it shows duration throughout that period."
