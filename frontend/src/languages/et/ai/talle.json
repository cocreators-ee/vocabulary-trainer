  "context": "The Estonian word 'talle' is the allative singular form of the pronoun 'ta', meaning 'he/she'. It indicates motion to or toward a person, and translates as 'to him/her' in English. The word is used unstressed in sentences; when stressed, 'temale' (allative of 'tema') would be used instead."
