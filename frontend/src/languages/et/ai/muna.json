  "context": "The Estonian word 'muna' has multiple meanings. Its primary meaning is 'egg', referring to both animal eggs (like chicken eggs) and the reproductive cells of animals. In a vulgar context, it can refer to testicles or balls. The word also describes oval or round objects in shape-related contexts. It's commonly used in everyday language for food items like chicken eggs, as well as in biological contexts."
