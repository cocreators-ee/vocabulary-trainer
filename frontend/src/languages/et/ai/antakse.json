  "context": "The word 'antakse' is the impersonal present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'andma', which means 'to give'. In Estonian, this construction is used to express passive voice without using a specific subject. It indicates that something is being given or provided in general, without specifying who is giving it. This form commonly appears in contexts where information, recognition, or items are distributed or provided."
