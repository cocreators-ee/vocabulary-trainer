  "context": "The word 'naudi' is the imperative form of the Estonian verb 'nautima', which means 'to enjoy'. It's used to tell someone to enjoy something. While there are some dictionary references mentioning it in connection with 'aeronaut' (Õhusõitja), its primary meaning as a command form of 'enjoy' is much more common and relevant for everyday usage."
