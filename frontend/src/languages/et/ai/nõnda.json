  "context": "The Estonian word 'nõnda' is an adverb with multiple meanings and uses. It can mean 'so', 'thus', 'therefore', or 'in this way'. It's often used to describe how something should be done, to express manner or method. The word has a slightly more limited usage compared to 'nii' and can sometimes sound more colloquial. Nõnda is also used in conditional sentences to show direct temporal sequence (like the English structure 'as... so...'). It appears in various contexts including instructions, comparisons, cause-effect relationships, and expressions of degree."
