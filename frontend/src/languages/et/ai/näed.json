  "context": "The Estonian word 'näed' is the second-person singular present indicative form of the verb 'nägema', meaning 'to see'. It corresponds to English pronouns 'you' (singular) with the verb 'see' in the simple present tense. This form is used when addressing one person and asking or stating what they can perceive visually. The word follows Estonian grammar rules where the -d suffix indicates second-person singular present tense conjugation."
