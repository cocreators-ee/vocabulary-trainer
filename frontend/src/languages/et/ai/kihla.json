  "context": "The Estonian word 'kihla' is used in compound expressions to mean 'engaged' or 'betrothed'. It appears only in combinations with other words (as indicated by the dictionary note '(ainult ühendites)' which means 'only in combinations'). In the examples, it's used in phrases like on kihlas (is engaged), oleme omavahel kihlas (are engaged to each other), and olid pikalt kihlas (were engaged for a long time)."
