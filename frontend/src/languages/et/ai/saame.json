  "context": "The word 'saame' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the verb 'saa-' meaning 'to get/receive/be able to'. It's commonly used to express ability or possibility in Estonian. The 'me-' prefix indicates it's from the perspective of 'we', and the '-me' ending shows it's in the present tense for 1st person plural subjects."
