  "context": "The word 'otsuseid' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'otsus', which means 'decision'. The suffix '-d' indicates it's in plural, and the ending '-id' shows it's in the partitive case. This form is typically used when referring to decisions as objects or when discussing multiple decisions without specifying the exact number."
