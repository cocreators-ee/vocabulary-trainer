  "context": "The Estonian word 'anda' is the basic verb form meaning 'to give'. It's an infinitive verb that can be conjugated in different tenses. In present tense it becomes 'annan' (I give), past tense 'andisin' (I gave), and it can take various objects depending on what is being given. The word follows Estonian grammar rules for verb conjugation and commonly appears in everyday contexts when transferring something from one person to another."
