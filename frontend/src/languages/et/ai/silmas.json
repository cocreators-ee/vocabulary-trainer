  "context": "The Estonian word 'silmas' is an inessive case form of the word 'silm' (eye). It typically appears after verbs like 'näha' (to see) or 'vaadata' (to look/watch), and indicates that something is being looked at with one's eyes. This prepositional construction shows what someone is focusing their vision on."
