  "context": "'On' is the third-person singular form of the Estonian verb 'olema', which means 'to be'. It's used as a copula to connect subjects and predicates, similar to the English verb 'be' in its present tense forms (is, am, are). In Estonian, like many other languages, the verb must agree with the subject in person and number."
