  "context": "The Estonian word 'on' is the third-person singular and plural present indicative form of the verb 'olema', meaning 'to be'. It functions similarly to English verbs like 'is', 'are', and 'am' in that it connects a subject to its predicate. In Estonian, unlike English, this same form can be used for both singular and third-person plural subjects."
