  "context": "The word 'pojale' appears to be an adjectival form in Estonian, likely derived from the root word 'pojane' which relates to qualities or characteristics of a son. It describes something that is appropriate, suitable, or characteristic of being a son - showing filial piety, respect, or behavior expected of a son. The dictionary definition mentions it as describing proper conduct and respectful treatment toward elders."
