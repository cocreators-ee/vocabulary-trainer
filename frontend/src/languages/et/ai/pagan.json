  "context": "The Estonian word 'pagan' refers to someone who follows a pre-Christian, non-monotheistic religion. It can be used as an adjective describing things related to paganism or as a noun referring to a pagan person. In Estonia, this relates to the ancient Baltic and Finnic beliefs that existed before Christianity became dominant."
