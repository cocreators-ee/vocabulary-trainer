  "context": "The Estonian word 'pagan' has multiple meanings. It can refer to a non-Christian person (similar to heathen), an evil spirit or devil, and is also used as an interjection expressing frustration or surprise similar to English curses like 'damn' or 'darn'. The word's form changes based on case - nominative form is 'pagan', genitive is 'pagana', partitive is 'paganat'. As an exclamation, it can be used with various question words (kes, mis, kus) to express surprise or emphasis."
