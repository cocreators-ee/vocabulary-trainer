  "context": "The word 'keelt' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'keel', which means either 'language' or 'tongue'. In this case, it indicates that something is being done with language or speech. The Wiktionary entry confirms that 'keelt' is specifically the partitive singular form, meaning it would be used when referring to some amount or aspect of language but not the entirety of it. For example, one might use 'keelt käid' (literally 'tongue walks/goes') which is an idiom for speaking."
