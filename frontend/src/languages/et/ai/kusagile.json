  "context": "The word 'kusagile' is an Estonian adverb meaning 'somewhere' or 'to some place'. It can be used affirmatively (meaning to some unspecified place) or negatively (meaning not at all, nowhere). In affirmative usage, it indicates movement toward an undetermined location. In negative usage with 'ei', it means 'not anywhere' or 'nowhere'. The word is formed from 'kus' (where) and the suffix '-agile' indicating direction to a place."
