  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõik' is a versatile pronoun that can mean 'all', 'everything', or 'everyone'. It's used to refer to the entirety of something, people collectively, or as an indefinite pronoun meaning 'everything'. In its basic form it's used in nominative case, but it changes form based on grammatical context - for example 'kõigega' means 'with everyone/all' (essive case), and 'kõikidesse' means 'into all places' (illative plural)."
