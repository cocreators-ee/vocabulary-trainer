  "context": "The word 'naisele' appears to be part of the compound word 'ebanaiselik', which means 'unladylike'. Based on the context, it seems to be an instrumental case form that would translate to something like 'to/for a woman' or modify 'unladylike' as describing something unsuitable for women. In the example given in the dictionary definition, 'Ebanaiselik kõnnak naisele' suggests it's modifying 'kõnnak' (gait/walk) to mean an unladylike gait that is unbecoming of a woman."
