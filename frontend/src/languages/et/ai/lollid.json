  "context": "The word 'lollid' is the plural form of 'loll' in Estonian, meaning 'fools' or 'stupid people'. It refers to individuals with little intelligence or poor judgment. The dictionary definition mentions it can also be translated as 'puupea' (blockhead) and describes someone with 'vähese, raske taibuga' (little, slow-witted). In the example sentence, it's used derogatorily to criticize people who are incapable of even simple tasks."
