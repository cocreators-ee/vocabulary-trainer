  "context": "'Tehes' is the partitive case form of 'teha', meaning 'to make' or 'to do'. It functions as a gerund-like construction indicating an ongoing action. The word appears in contexts where someone is engaged in doing something, and its partitive form shows that the action is incomplete or in progress. In Estonian grammar, this form is commonly used with verbs of motion to indicate simultaneous actions."
