  "context": "The word 'jäetud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'jätta', which means 'to leave'. As a participle, it functions as an adjective meaning something that has been left behind or abandoned. In the example sentence provided in the dictionary definition, it appears to describe something related to feeding ('sööti jäetud' - feed left), though the context suggests it might be describing something that was prepared or set aside for feeding animals."
