  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõnikord' is an adverb that means 'sometimes', 'occasionally', or 'at times'. It indicates that something happens intermittently but not regularly. The word is formed from 'mõni' (some) and '-kord' (time), literally meaning 'some time' or 'one time'. In Estonian grammar, it's used to express frequency in the same way as English speakers use 'sometimes'."
