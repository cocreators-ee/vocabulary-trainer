  "context": "The Estonian word 'igaüks' is an indefinite pronoun that means 'everyone' or 'everybody'. It's formed by combining 'iga' (meaning 'every') with 'üks' (meaning 'one'). This word refers to all people in a group collectively, emphasizing each individual person separately. In Estonian grammar, it has different forms depending on case: nominative form is 'igaüks', genitive is 'igaühe', and partitive can be either 'igaüht/igaühte' or 'igatüht/igatühte'. The word is used to refer to all members of a group while emphasizing each person individually, similar to the English usage of 'everyone'."
