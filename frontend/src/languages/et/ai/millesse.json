  "context": "The Estonian word 'millesse' is a compound form that combines the inessive case suffix '-sse' with the interrogative pronoun/mill-, meaning it functions as an interrogative or relative form asking 'into which' or expressing 'wherein'. It's used to ask about the container or medium into which something is dipped or put. The word appears specifically in dictionary definitions describing dip sauces - it asks what food items are dipped into, or describes a sauce that things are dipped into."
