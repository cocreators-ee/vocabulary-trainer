  "context": "The Estonian word 'haige' has multiple meanings depending on its grammatical form. As an adjective, it means 'sick' or 'ill', referring to someone who is in poor health suffering from a disease (e.g., 'haige inimene' - sick person). In the partitive case, when combined with verbs like 'saama' (to get) or 'tegema' (to do), it means 'pain' or 'hurt' (e.g., 'põlv teeb haiget' - knee hurts). As a noun, 'haige' refers to a sick person. It can also be used figuratively in compound words to describe someone with an intense passion for something (e.g., 'raamatute haige' - book enthusiast/obsessed with books)."
