  "context": "The word 'saare' appears to be related to the Estonian word for Corsica (Korsika), and when used as an adjective, it means 'Corsican' or can indicate origin from Corsica. In the dictionary entry, we see 'korsiklane' which means a person from Corsica, suggesting that 'saare' is likely related to describing things or people originating from the island of Corsica."
