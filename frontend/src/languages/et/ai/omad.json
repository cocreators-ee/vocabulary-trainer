  "context": "'Oma' is an Estonian adverb used to emphasize the quantity or extent of something, meaning 'not less than', 'as much as', or 'fully'. It emphasizes that the amount mentioned is approximate but at least that much. For example, 'oma 30 km' means 'at least 30 kilometers', and 'oma viis kilo raske' means 'weighing as much as five kilograms'. The word helps to convey a sense of substantial quantity or degree."
