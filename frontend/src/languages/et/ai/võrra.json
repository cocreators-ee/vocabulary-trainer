  "context": "In Estonian, 'võrra' is an adverb used to indicate the degree or amount of change. It typically follows a comparative adjective and shows how much something has changed in comparison to its previous state. For example, when saying something became 'kõrgemaks võrra', it means it became taller by that specific amount."
