  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõikjal' is an adverb that means 'everywhere' or 'all over'. It indicates that something exists, occurs, or can be found in all places. The word consists of two parts: 'kõik' meaning 'all' and the suffix '-jalg-' which forms location-related words, similar to how English uses '-where' in 'anywhere', 'somewhere', etc."
