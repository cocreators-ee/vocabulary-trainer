  "context": "The Estonian word 'samas' is an adverb with three main meanings: 1) meaning 'right after' or 'immediately following', indicating something happens consecutively; 2) meaning 'at the same time' or 'simultaneously', used to contrast two things happening together; and 3) meaning 'here' or 'in this very place'. It functions as a temporal connector that links events in time, either showing immediate succession or simultaneous occurrence."
