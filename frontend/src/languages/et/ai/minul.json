  "context": "Minul is the adessive singular form of 'mina' (I/me) in Estonian. It's used when the pronoun is stressed in a sentence, meaning it carries emphasis or stands out more prominently. The adessive case typically indicates possession or location ('at/on/with me'). When unstressed, the shorter form 'mul' is used instead."
