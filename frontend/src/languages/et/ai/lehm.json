  "context": "The Estonian word 'lehm' primarily means a female cow (Bos primigenius taurus), specifically from the time of first calving onward. It refers to adult female cattle used for milk production. In derogatory contexts, it can refer to a fat or slovenly woman. The word follows specific declension patterns in Estonian grammar and has compound formations like 'piimalehm' (milk cow) and 'lüpsi-lehm' (milking cow)."
