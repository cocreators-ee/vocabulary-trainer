  "context": "\"Silma\" is the partitive case form of \"silm\" (eye) in Estonian. It's used when you're talking about some eyes or a portion of eyes, often seen in contexts like \"ta oli oma silmas pisaraid\" (he had tears in his eye). The word \"silm\" means 'eye' and the partitive case indicates that it's an incomplete action or state."
