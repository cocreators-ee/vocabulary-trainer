  "context": "The word 'huvitab' is the 3rd person singular present tense form of the verb 'huvitama' which means 'to interest'. It indicates that someone or something finds another subject interesting. For example, when we say 'Poisi huvitab tehnika', it means 'The boy is interested in technology'. The word comes from 'huvi' (interest) and '-tab' is a common verb ending indicating the 3rd person singular present tense."
