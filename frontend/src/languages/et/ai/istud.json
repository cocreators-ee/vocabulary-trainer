  "context": "The Estonian word 'istud' is the second person singular present form of the verb 'istuma', which means to sit. In this context, it's part of an idiomatic expression meaning to saw off or cut down a branch that one is sitting on - essentially acting against one's own interests in a self-destructive way. This idiom conveys the idea of making decisions that will ultimately harm oneself, similar to cutting away support beneath one's own position."
