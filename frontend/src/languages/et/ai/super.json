  "context": "The Estonian word 'super' is used both as an adverb and an adjective. As an adverb, it means 'especially', 'very', or 'extremely'. As an adjective (before noun), it means 'super' or 'excellent'. It's borrowed from English but integrated into Estonian usage. The examples show how it can describe a girl ('kena tüdruk'), goods ('kaup'), and people like Travolta."
