  "context": "The word 'sõnagi' in Estonian is an adverb that means 'also', 'too', or 'as well'. It's used to add additional information or emphasize that something else is included. The word consists of 'sõna' (word) plus the suffix '-gi' which indicates inclusion or addition. In sentences, it typically follows the verb or appears at a natural position in the sentence where the additional emphasis is needed."
