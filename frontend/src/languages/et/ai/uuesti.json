  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'uuesti' means 'again' or 'anew'. It can be used to indicate repetition of an action, returning to a previous state, or doing something from the beginning but differently. The word is formed from 'uus' (new) + '-sti', suggesting starting anew or doing something once more."
