  "context": "The Estonian word 'rikutud' is an adjective meaning 'decayed' or 'carious', referring to teeth that have been damaged by dental caries (cavities). It's the plural nominative form of 'rikutud'. In medical contexts, it specifically describes teeth affected by tooth decay or cavities. The word comes from the root 'rikuda' meaning 'to spoil' or 'to damage', so literally means 'spoiled' or 'damaged' when referring to teeth."
