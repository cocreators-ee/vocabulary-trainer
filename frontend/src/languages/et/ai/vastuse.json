  "context": "The Estonian word 'vastuse' is the genitive case form of the noun 'vastus', which means 'answer', 'response', or 'reply'. In the genitive case, it indicates possession or relationship - so 'vastuse' can mean 'of an answer/response' or be used to show what belongs to an answer. It's commonly used in phrases like asking for someone's opinion on a question ('Milline on sinu vastuse sellele küsimusele?' means 'What is your answer to this question?')."
