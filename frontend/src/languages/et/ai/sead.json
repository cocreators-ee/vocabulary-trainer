  "context": "The word 'sead' has multiple meanings in Estonian. It can be the nominative plural form of 'siga' meaning pigs, or it can be the second-person singular present indicative form of the verb 'seadma' meaning to set or place. In forestry contexts, it refers to planting arrangements with specific dimensions (20 x 10-12 cm). The phrase 'käte sead' refers to hand positions or arrangements, particularly in dancing."
