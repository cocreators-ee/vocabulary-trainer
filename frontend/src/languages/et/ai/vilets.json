It can refer to physical health (a sick person), material possessions (worn-out clothes), abilities (poor skills), economic situation (meager conditions), or moral character (contemptible person). The word carries a strong sense of deficiency and inferiority across various contexts - from describing someone's poor health to criticizing the low quality of products or services."
