  "context": "The word 'hmm' in Estonian is an interjection used to express hesitation, contemplation, or uncertainty. It's similar to English 'hmm', 'um', or 'er'. This is a filler sound that people make when they are thinking about something before responding. The Estonian usage matches the English interjection pattern closely."
