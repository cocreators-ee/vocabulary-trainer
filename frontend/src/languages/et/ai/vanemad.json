  "context": "The word 'vanemad' is the plural form of the Estonian noun 'vanem', which means 'parent'. It refers to both parents collectively - father and mother. In Estonian, like many other languages, nouns have different forms for singular and plural. 'Vanemad' specifically denotes multiple parents rather than just one."
