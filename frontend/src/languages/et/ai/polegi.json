  "context": "'polegi' is a negative particle used to emphasize negation in Estonian, similar to 'not at all' or 'by no means' in English. It's often used for emphasis and can be part of more complex negative constructions such as with 'ei'. The word may appear in sentences where the speaker wants to stress the certainty of the negation."
