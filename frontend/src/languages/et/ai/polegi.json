  "context": "The Estonian word 'polegi' is a combination of 'pole' (negative form of 'on', meaning 'is/are') and the particle 'gi' which adds emphasis or indicates 'also/either'. It's used to add emphasis to negation, similar to saying 'not even' or 'either not' in English. The word typically appears at the end of sentences and carries a sense of additional information or slight emphasis about what is not happening."
