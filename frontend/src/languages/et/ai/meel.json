  "context": "The Estonian word 'meel' is highly polysemous with multiple distinct meanings: 1) The five senses of perception (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch); 2) A person's nature, temperament or disposition; 3) Emotions and feelings; 4) Willingness or desire; 5) Mind or intelligence (often in colloquial expressions about losing one's mind); 6) Memory; 7) Opinions or thoughts. The word appears in numerous fixed phrases where its meaning depends on context, such as 'hea meel' (good feeling/glad), 'paha meel' (bad mood/sadness), and 'meelde jääma' (to remember)."
