  "context": "The Estonian word 'inimene' refers to a human being or person. It's the general term for humans as biological and social beings with thinking abilities, language skills, and who create and use tools to influence their environment. The word can be used to describe people of different characteristics (good/bad, tall/short, rich/poor), adults in contrast to children, inhabitants of a place, or members of a community. It has various compound forms that specify particular types of humans or contexts where someone operates (like 'linna inimene' - city person)."
