  "context": "The word 'valetanud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'valeta', which means 'to lie'. It indicates that lying has occurred in the past, and it's formed with the '-nud' suffix which is typical for Estonian past participles. This form would typically be used with auxiliary verbs like 'olema' (to be) to compound tenses such as 'have lied' or 'has lied'."
