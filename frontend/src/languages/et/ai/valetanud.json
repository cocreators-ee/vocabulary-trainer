  "context": "The word 'valetanud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'valema', which means to lie or deceive. In this case, it refers to someone who has lied successfully or skillfully. The dictionary definition mentions 'kordaläinult' (successfully/with success) and 'õnnestunult' (successfully), indicating that this is about lying in a successful manner rather than just any kind of falsehood."
