  "context": "The Estonian verb 'istuma' means 'to sit down' or 'to be seated'. It's an imperfective verb that describes the action of taking a seat. In first person singular present tense it becomes 'istan', in third person singular 'istub', and when negated, you would use 'ei istu'. The word follows Estonian conjugation patterns with different forms for different persons and tenses."
