  "context": "The word 'toitu' appears to be a misspelling or incorrect form of the Estonian verb 'toida', which means 'to feed'. However, based on the provided example sentences and context, it seems this might be intended as the 1st person singular present tense of 'toitma' (to eat), but this is not standard Estonian. Standard Estonian for 'I eat' would be 'Ma söön', not 'Ma toitu'. There may be a regional dialect variation or an error in the source data."
