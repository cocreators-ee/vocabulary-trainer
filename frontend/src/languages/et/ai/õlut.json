  "context": "The word 'õlut' is the partitive case of the Estonian noun 'õlu', which means beer. The partitive case (-t ending) indicates an incomplete or indefinite amount, so it would translate to 'some beer' or just 'beer' in English depending on context. This form is commonly used when referring to drinking beer or having some beer."
