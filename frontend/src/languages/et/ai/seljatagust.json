  "context": "The word 'seljatagust' is the adessive case (where something is located at or on) of 'seljatagune', meaning 'behind the back' or 'at the rear'. It can refer to the physical back side of objects, a support system, or something done secretly from behind. In Estonian grammar, this form often indicates location - so it means 'at/on the back part' or 'having/with support on the back'. The word is commonly used in both literal (physical backs) and figurative contexts (support, hidden actions)."
