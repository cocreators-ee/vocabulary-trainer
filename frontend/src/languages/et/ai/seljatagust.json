  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'seljatagust' is formed from 'seljataha' (back, behind) + the adessive case '-st' suffix. It means something done secretly or without someone's knowledge, similar to English expressions like 'behind one's back' or 'secretly'. This adverb modifies verbs to indicate that an action is performed covertly or when someone isn't looking."
