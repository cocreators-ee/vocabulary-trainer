  "context": "The Estonian word 'pisike' is an adjective that means small, tiny, or little. It's a diminutive form of the word 'pisis', which refers to something very small. The '-ke' suffix in Estonian often creates a diminutive form, making something sound smaller or more affectionate. This word is typically used to describe the size of objects, animals, or people in an endearing way."
