  "context": "The Estonian word 'ahv' primarily means ape or monkey. It can refer to the animal itself (like in the first sentence about different types of monkeys), be used metaphorically for someone who climbs like a monkey, and in slang it can mean food package (as seen in the military context). The word has both literal meanings referring to primates and figurative uses describing people or things that resemble monkeys in appearance or behavior."
