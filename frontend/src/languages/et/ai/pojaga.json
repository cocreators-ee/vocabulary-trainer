  "context": "Pojaga is an Estonian word that means 'with the boy' or 'with a son'. It's in the illative case, indicating movement toward or into something. The base form of this word would be 'poeg' (boy/son), and '-ga' is a suffix meaning 'with' or 'accompanied by'. This construction shows possession or accompaniment, similar to saying 'someone with their son' in English."
