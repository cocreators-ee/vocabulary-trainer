  "context": "The word 'haavatud' is the past participle form of the verb 'haavata' (to wound/injure). It functions as an adjective meaning 'wounded' or 'injured', and when used as a noun, it refers to 'the wounded person' or 'victim'. In Estonian grammar, this word shows the state of having received wounds. The dictionary examples show it being used with '-ile' case suffix indicating recipient (to the wounded) and plural form (-id/-uile) for multiple victims."
