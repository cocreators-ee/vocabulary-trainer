  "context": "The Estonian word 'muidu' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings. It can mean 'otherwise' or 'in other circumstances' when indicating alternative outcomes (e.g., 'Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late'). It also means 'typically' or 'usually' when describing regular behavior (e.g., 'Normally such a calm person was irritated today'). Additionally, it can express that something happens 'for free' without payment (e.g., 'I wouldn't want this anyway, I'll pay'). The word's meaning depends heavily on the context in which it appears."
