  "context": "The Estonian word 'paari' is an adverb that means 'in pairs' or 'coupled together'. It's used to indicate when two things or people are joined together as a pair. This can be used for putting socks on feet together, forming couples romantically, or pairing up for activities. The word appears after verbs of action like 'panema' (to put), 'läksid' (went), or 'panna' (to make/put)."
