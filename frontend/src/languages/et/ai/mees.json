  "context": "The Estonian word 'mees' is a noun that means 'man' or 'male person'. It's the most common term for an adult human male in Estonian. As with many other languages, it can also be used to refer to one's husband ('mees' as 'husband'). The word has different forms depending on case and number: singular nominative form is 'mees', but in genitive it would be 'mehe'. It doesn't have gender-specific articles like some other languages. In informal contexts, it can also function somewhat like the English address term 'gentleman' or mister."
