  "context": "The Estonian word 'mees' primarily means 'man' and refers to an adult human male. It can also mean 'husband' when referring to a married man, and in some contexts simply means 'person' without specifying gender. The word has various forms: mehe (genitive), meest (partitive), mehesse (illative), meeste (genitive plural), mehi (partitive plural), meestesse (illative plural). In compound words like 'töömees', it means worker, and in 'abielumees' it specifically means husband. The word carries connotations of adulthood, masculinity, and can be used both literally and figuratively to describe character traits associated with traditional masculine qualities."
