  "context": "The word 'elusana' is an Estonian adjective derived from 'elu' (life) and the suffix '-sana', meaning 'alive' or 'living'. It refers to something that has life, is not dead, exists in a living state. The word can describe both animate beings (people, animals) and things that are functioning actively or vividly. In Estonian grammar, it typically follows the adjective pattern with possible case endings depending on its grammatical role in a sentence."
