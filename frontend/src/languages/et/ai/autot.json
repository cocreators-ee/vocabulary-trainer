  "context": "The word 'autot' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'auto', which means car or automobile. The partitive case is used to indicate an incomplete action, unspecified quantity, or when something is being possessed indirectly. In this form, it often appears in contexts where someone has a car, sees a car, or there's involvement with a car without specifying exact ownership or complete possession."
