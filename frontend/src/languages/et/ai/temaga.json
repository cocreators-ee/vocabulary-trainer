  "context": "The word 'temaga' is an Estonian expression that means 'with him/her/it' but when combined with the swear word 'kurat' (meaning devil/curse), it becomes a colloquial, slightly offensive phrase expressing disregard or annoyance toward someone. The combination 'kurat temaga' translates roughly to 'to hell with him/her/it' or 'damn him/her/it'. It's used to express that you don't care about something concerning the person, often in situations of frustration or dismissal."
