  "context": "The word 'aabits' refers to an ABC book or primer used for teaching the basics of reading and writing. It can also metaphorically refer to the fundamental principles or basic knowledge in a particular field or subject area. The '-stki' ending on 'millestki' indicates this is derived from 'aabits' but with additional grammatical particles that suggest emphasis or questioning."
