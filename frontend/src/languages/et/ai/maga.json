  "context": "'Maga' is the present indicative connegative form of the Estonian verb 'magama', which means to sleep. It is used in negative sentences and questions, similar to how English uses 'doesn't sleep' or 'don't sleep'. The connegative form in Estonian is formed by adding '-i' to the main verb stem when negated with 'ei'. So 'maga' specifically refers to not sleeping or being asleep in present tense."
