  "context": "The word 'sel' in Estonian is primarily used as an adessive singular form of the demonstrative pronoun 'see'. It means 'this' or 'these' and can function as a standalone pronoun. Additionally, it can be used in temporal constructions meaning 'at the time when' or 'while', as seen in the dictionary definition example. Its usage depends on context but typically refers to something near or present."
