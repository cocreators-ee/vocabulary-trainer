  "context": "In Estonian, 'sel' is an demonstrative pronoun or adjective that typically means 'this', 'that', or 'the'. It's the inessive case singular form of 'see' (this/that). Inessive case indicates location within something, so 'sel' often functions as 'in this', 'on this', or 'at this' depending on context. It's commonly used to specify which particular thing is being referred to within a larger context."
