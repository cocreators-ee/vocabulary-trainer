  "context": "Mingisugune is an Estonian adjective used to indicate an unspecified or indeterminate type, kind, or variety. It can be used in both affirmative sentences where it refers to 'some kind of' or 'a certain type', and in negative sentences where it means 'no kind of' when combined with the negation word 'mitte'. The word is often used when something is unknown, undefined, or unspecified."
