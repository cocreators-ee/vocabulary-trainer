  "context": "The Estonian verb 'kahtlen' means to express uncertainty or lack of confidence in something. It is used when someone has reservations, questions the truthfulness, accuracy, or validity of something. The word appears to be from a literary context as shown in the dictionary example where it refers to doubting whether someone saw anything or was even conscious of the companion's presence."
