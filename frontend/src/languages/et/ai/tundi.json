  "context": "The word 'tundi' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'tund', which means 'hour'. It can also be the illative singular form of the same root. In the partitive case, it indicates an amount or duration that isn't specified exactly (like 'for some time' or 'an hour'). The Wiktionary definition confirms this word appears in both grammatical cases."
