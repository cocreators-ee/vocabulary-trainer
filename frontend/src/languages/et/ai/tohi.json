  "context": "The Estonian word 'tohi' is an inflectional form of the verb 'tohtima'. It specifically represents the present indicative connegative or second-person singular present imperative form. This means it's used in contexts where something is prohibited, forbidden, or not allowed. The negative form 'ei tohi' translates to 'must not' or 'is not allowed to' and expresses obligation with prohibition. In its positive form (used as an imperative), 'tohi' would mean 'may' or 'is permitted to', but the dictionary definitions indicate it's primarily used in prohibitive contexts."
