  "context": "The Estonian word 'tund' has three main meanings: 1) as a unit of time (60 minutes), 2) as an educational period or lesson, and 3) as a specific moment in time. It can refer to the 24-hour divisions of day/night, school class periods, or critical moments in life. The word declines regularly in Estonian with genitive 'tunni', partitive 'tundi'."
