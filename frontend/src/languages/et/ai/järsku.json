  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'järsku' means suddenly or abruptly. It indicates a quick, unexpected change in action, appearance, or situation. The word can describe physical movements (standing up suddenly), departures (leaving abruptly), weather changes (turning cloudy suddenly), or other rapid transitions. In some contexts it can also express doubt or possibility ('maybe', 'perhaps'), but the primary meaning relates to suddenness and abruptness."
