  "context": "The Estonian word 'veel' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can indicate that an action or state continues (yet/still), express addition or continuation (again/besides/also), strengthen comparisons (even more), or convey surprise/impatience in rhetorical questions. Its meaning shifts from temporal relationships to additive functions to emotional emphasis, making it one of the most common and flexible words in Estonian."
