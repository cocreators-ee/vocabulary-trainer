  "context": "The Estonian word 'meeldib' is the 3rd person singular present form of the verb 'meelda', which means 'to like' or 'to please'. It's commonly used in everyday conversations to express that something is liked by someone. The structure typically follows 'Subject + meeldiv/pleasing to + Object', as seen in the examples where we ask if a book pleases/is liked by someone, or describe what activities are pleasing to people."
