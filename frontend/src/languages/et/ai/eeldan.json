  "context": "The Estonian word 'eeldan' is the first-person singular present form of the verb 'eeldama'. It has two main meanings: 1) to require something as a prerequisite or condition, where it indicates that something necessitates certain conditions or preparation; 2) to assume, believe, or consider something likely. The word can be used when talking about requirements for jobs or activities (what is needed), or when making assumptions about people's behavior or future events."
