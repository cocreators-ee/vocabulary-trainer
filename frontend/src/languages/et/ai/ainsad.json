  "context": "The word 'ainsad' is the plural form of 'ainus' in Estonian. It means 'only' or 'the only ones'. In sentences, it's used to indicate exclusivity - when something is limited to a specific group and no others have access to it or can do it. The word agrees with the subject (plural) that follows it."
