  "context": "The Estonian word 'pane' is an imperative form of the verb 'panema', which means to put, place, set or consider. It's commonly used in commands or requests when telling someone to put something somewhere or to take certain action. For example, 'Pane mind k천igepealt siia' means 'Put me here first.' The word can also be used idiomatically to mean 'consider' or 'regard', as in 'Ma ei pane sulle r천hku' (I don't place importance on you) meaning I don't value you highly."
