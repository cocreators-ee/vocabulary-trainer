  "context": "The Estonian word 'nimetatakse' is the 3rd person singular present passive form of the verb 'nimetama', which means 'to name' or 'to call'. It is used when describing what something is called or how something is referred to, without specifying who is doing the naming. This construction is commonly used in Estonian to express that an object, person, or concept has a particular name or designation."
