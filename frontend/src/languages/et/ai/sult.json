  "context": "The word 'sult' is the Estonian formal singular pronoun in the genitive case, used to address someone formally with respect. It functions as the possessive form meaning 'of you' or 'to you' when speaking formally to one person. In English, this would correspond to 'your' or 'to you' in formal contexts."
