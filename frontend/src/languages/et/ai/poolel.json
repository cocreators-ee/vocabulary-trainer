  "context": "The Estonian word 'poolel' is an adverbial form that indicates something occurring in the middle or at a midpoint. It can refer to time (half past, during), location (in the middle of), or quantity (half of). In the dictionary example provided, it's used with 'sajandil' (century) to mean 'in the first half of the 19th century'. The word derives from 'pool' meaning 'half', with '-l' being an adverbial suffix."
