  "context": "The Estonian word 'poolel' is an adessive case form that indicates being in the middle of something or at a halfway point. It's commonly used with time expressions (like 'poolel öösel' - at midnight) and to describe physical position between two points. The word derives from 'pool' meaning half, so 'poolel' essentially means 'in/at/on the half'."
