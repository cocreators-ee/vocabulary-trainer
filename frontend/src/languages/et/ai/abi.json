The word also has several grammatical forms: in genitive case it remains 'abi', in partitive form 'abisid', and can be used with the postposition 'abil' meaning 'with the help of'. Additionally, 'abi' can refer to an assistant or aide (like a minister's assistant), and can function as a postposition indicating means or agency. The word appears in compound terms like 'esmaabi' (first aid) and 'humanitaarabi' (humanitarian aid)."
