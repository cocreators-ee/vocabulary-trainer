  "context": "The word 'ole' is the second-person singular imperative form of the Estonian verb 'olema', which means 'to be'. It's used as a command or request, similar to 'be!' in English. In the present indicative connegative form, it can also appear with negation (ei ole) meaning 'is not' or 'are not'. The word is commonly used in everyday speech for commands like telling someone to be good ('Ole hea!') or asking what someone is ('Mis sa oled?')."
