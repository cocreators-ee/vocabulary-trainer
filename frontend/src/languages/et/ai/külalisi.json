  "context": "The word 'külalisi' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'külaline', which means guest or visitor. The partitive case in Estonian is used to indicate an incomplete action, partial object, or when talking about a quantity of something that isn't a complete whole. In this case, 'külalisi' refers to guests/visitors without specifying exact numbers or implying they are the only ones."
