  "context": "The Estonian word 'milline' is an interrogative and exclamatory pronoun/determiner that serves multiple functions. It can be used to ask questions about qualities or choices (e.g., 'Which one?', 'What kind?'), form exclamations expressing evaluation or emphasis, and also appears in various fixed expressions. Its meaning changes depending on context - it can be neutral when asking a question, but becomes evaluative or emphatic in exclamatory statements."
