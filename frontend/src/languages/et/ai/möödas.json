  "context": "The Estonian word 'möödas' is an adverb that indicates something has passed or gone by in time or space. When used temporally, it means a period of time has ended (e.g., summer is over). When used spatially, it means moving past something or someone (e.g., we have already passed the church and cemetery). The word can refer to physical objects passing by, seasons ending, time periods elapsing, or even abstract concepts like opportunities that are gone."
