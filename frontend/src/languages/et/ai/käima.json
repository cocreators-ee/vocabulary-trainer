  "context": "Käima is a versatile Estonian verb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'to walk' when referring to physical movement, but it also commonly means 'to go' (especially for habitual or regular trips), 'to move' (in games like chess or checkers), 'to work/run' (for machines), 'to happen/occur/go on', 'to date' (when used with the comitative case), and 'to be suitable/fit/last/work'. The verb shows extensive polysemy, connecting physical movement to more abstract concepts of regular activity, functionality, and occurrence."
