  "context": "The Estonian verb 'käima' is a frequentative verb that means 'to go', 'to walk', or 'to visit'. It indicates repeated, habitual action rather than a one-time event. Unlike the simple verb 'minema' (to go), which suggests movement from A to B without return, 'käima' implies going somewhere and typically coming back, often for a short duration or specific purpose. The verb is commonly used with the illative case (-sse) to indicate destination, such as 'käida poes' (go to the store)."
