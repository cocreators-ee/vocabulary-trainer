  "context": "The Estonian word 'nähes' is the elative case form of the verb 'nägema' (to see). It's used to indicate that an action happened after seeing something. In English, this would typically be translated as 'seeing' or 'having seen'. This form is often used at the beginning of a sentence to show the reason for the main clause, similar to how we use 'after seeing...' in English."
