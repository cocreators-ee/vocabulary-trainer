  "context": "Mamma is a colloquial term for mother or mom. It's an informal way to refer to one's mother, similar to how 'mama' or 'mom' are used in English. The word can be found in compound words like 'tite|mamma' (grandma), 'vana|mamma' (old grandma), and 'ämmamamma' (mother-in-law's mother). It shows affectionate and familiar usage rather than formal address."
