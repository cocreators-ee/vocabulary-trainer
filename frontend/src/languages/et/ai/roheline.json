  "context": "Roheline is an Estonian adjective meaning 'green' in English. It describes the color green but can also refer to unripe produce or leafy/green-colored things. In its basic form, it's used for masculine and neuter singular nouns, with different forms needed for other grammatical cases (e.g., rohelised for plural, rohelise for genitive singular)."
