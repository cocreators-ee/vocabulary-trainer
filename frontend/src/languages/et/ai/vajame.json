  "context": "The word 'vajame' appears to be part of the longer phrase 'kelletaolist vajame' which translates to 'we need someone like/such as'. This suggests that 'vajame' might mean 'we need', but in this context it's better understood as part of the expression indicating a requirement for a certain type of person. The dictionary definition shows this word is used in contexts where one is describing what kind of person or thing is needed."
