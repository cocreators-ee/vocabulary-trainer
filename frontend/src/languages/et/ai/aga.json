  "context": "The Estonian word 'aga' is a conjunction that functions similarly to English 'but', 'however', or 'yet'. It's used to contrast two ideas or clauses in a sentence. Like other conjunctions, it can appear at different positions within a sentence - sometimes at the beginning of a clause (like 'However...' in English) and sometimes connecting two independent clauses."
