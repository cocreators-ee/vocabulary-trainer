  "context": "Aga is a versatile Estonian conjunction that primarily functions as a contrastive connector similar to English 'but' or 'however'. It can connect sentences or clauses showing opposition between ideas. Additionally, it has several other uses: 1) As an emphatic adverb meaning 'only', 'just', or 'merely'; 2) In exclamations expressing surprise or emphasis; 3) To introduce objections or threats; and 4) As a discourse marker to introduce new topics, especially in spoken language. It's one of the most commonly used contrastive conjunctions in Estonian."
