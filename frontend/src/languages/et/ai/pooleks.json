  "context": "The Estonian word 'pooleks' is a positional case form (partitive) that means 'in half', 'into two equal parts', or simply 'half'. It's used to express division into two equal portions. In the first sentence, it shows an apple being divided equally between two people. The second example demonstrates children sharing toys equally among themselves. The third sentence shows a store starting its 'half-off' sale at noon."
