  "context": "The Estonian word 'pooleks' is an adverb that means 'in half', 'into two parts', or 'two ways'. It's used to indicate something being divided into equal or approximately equal portions, split in half, or shared between two parties. The word can be used literally (like paper torn in half) or figuratively (a conversation cut short). It can also mean 'each' or 'per person' when dividing things between two people."
