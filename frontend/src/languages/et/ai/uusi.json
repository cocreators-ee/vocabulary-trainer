  "context": "The word 'uusi' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian adjective 'uus', meaning 'new'. It appears to be used in contexts where multiple new things or people are being discussed, often as objects or complements in sentences. The dictionary examples show it can refer to new things (like mechanisms) or new people (like parents)."
