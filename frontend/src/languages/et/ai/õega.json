  "context": "The word 'õega' is an Estonian adverbial intensifier used to add emphasis or degree to adjectives. It functions similarly to English words like 'very', 'quite', or 'really'. The '-ga' ending in Estonian often indicates a comitative case (meaning 'with'), but when combined with õe (which can be related to 'õige' meaning 'right' or 'correct') it forms an intensifier. This is a common construction in Estonian for expressing degree of quality or intensity."
