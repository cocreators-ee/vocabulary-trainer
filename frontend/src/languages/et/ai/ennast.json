  "context": "The Estonian word 'ennast' is a reflexive pronoun meaning 'oneself'. It is used when the subject and object of a verb refer to the same person or thing. The word can change form depending on the case and number, but in this basic reflexive form it translates to various English equivalents like 'oneself', 'himself/herself/itself', or 'myself/yourself' depending on context."
