  "context": "\"Ennast\" is an Estonian reflexive pronoun that means \"oneself.\" It corresponds to English reflexive pronouns like myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves. In Estonian, this word changes form based on the person and number (enne for 1st person singular, ennast for others). It is used when the subject and object of a sentence are the same entity, typically appearing in the accusative case after reflexive verbs or to emphasize self-reference."
