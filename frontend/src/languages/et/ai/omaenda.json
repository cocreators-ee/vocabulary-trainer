  "context": "The Estonian word 'omaenda' is an intensive pronoun that emphasizes ownership or agency. It combines 'oma' (own) with 'enda' (self/oneself). It can be used to emphasize that someone did something themselves, saw/heard something firsthand, or acted independently. The word carries a sense of personal responsibility and direct involvement in the action being described."
