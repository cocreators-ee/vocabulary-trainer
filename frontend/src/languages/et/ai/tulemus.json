  "context": "The word 'tulemus' is an Estonian noun that means 'result', 'outcome', or 'finding'. It's in the nominative singular form. In Estonian, nouns decline based on case and number, so this would change in different grammatical contexts - for example, 'tulemused' (nominative plural) means 'results', and adding suffixes would show possession or other relationships."
