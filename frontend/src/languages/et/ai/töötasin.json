  "context": "The word 'töötasin' is a verb form in Estonian that comes from the verb 'töötama' (to work). In this context, it's used in a sentence where someone worked as a teacher for a couple of years. The dictionary entry shows an example sentence: 'Töötasin algul paar aastat õpetajana.' which translates to 'I worked initially/at first for a couple of years as a teacher.' This indicates that 'töötasin' is the first-person past tense form of the verb, meaning 'I worked'."
