  "context": "The word 'proua' is the Estonian equivalent of Mrs. or madam in English. It's a formal title used to address married women respectfully, similar to how 'Mrs.' is used in English. The word is always capitalized when used as a title before someone's name. In informal contexts, it might also be used more broadly to politely address any woman, though this is less common than the specific marital status usage."
