  "context": "The word 'keel' has two main meanings in Estonian: it can refer to the physical tongue (the organ in the mouth) or to a language system. As 'tongue', it's used when talking about anatomy, speech, or taste. As 'language', it refers to systems of communication like Eesti keel (Estonian language). The word is neutral and commonly used in both contexts."
