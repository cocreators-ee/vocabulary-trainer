  "context": "The Estonian word 'keel' is highly polysemous with multiple distinct meanings: 1) Physical tongue - the muscle in the mouth used for tasting, speaking, etc. (e.g., 'Tõmbas keelega üle margi' - pulled over the border with his tongue); 2) Language - system of communication (e.g., 'Soome, araabia, poola keeled' - Finnish, Arabic, Polish languages); 3) String of musical instrument (e.g., 'Viiulil katkes keel' - a string broke on the violin). It can also appear in figurative expressions like having a 'sharp tongue' meaning being verbally skilled or critical. The word follows regular Estonian declension patterns with genitive 'keele', partitive 'keelt', and plural 'keeled'. The different meanings are context-dependent, with physical references usually taking the definite form while language names typically appear in singular or plural forms without articles."
