  "context": "The Estonian word 'mälestused' is the plural form of 'mälestus', which means memory or recollection. It refers to memories, remembrances, or recollections that one has from past experiences. The word can be used to describe fond memories, personal recollections, or historical reminiscences. In Estonian grammar, '-dud' is a common plural ending for nouns, indicating that 'mälestused' represents multiple memories rather than just one."
