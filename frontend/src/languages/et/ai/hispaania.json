  "context": "The word 'hispaania' in Estonian has two main meanings: it can refer to the country Spain (when not capitalized) or the Spanish language/culture. In sentences, when referring to the country itself, it's typically written with a capital letter 'Hispaania', while when referring to the Spanish language, it appears as 'hispaania keel' (Spanish language). This word is commonly used in everyday Estonian when talking about travel, culture, or languages."
