  "context": "The word 'kohast' is an Estonian adverbial form derived from the genitive case of 'koht' (place/situation). It appears to be used in the compound form 'omast kohast' which means 'from its place' or 'in some way/extent'. The examples show it being used to indicate that something has a certain degree, quality, or appropriateness - suggesting partial justification, moderate extent, or appropriate manner. In modern Estonian usage, this construction often conveys the idea of something having merit or validity to some degree."
