  "context": "The word 'kohast' is an Estonian adverb that means 'in the right place' or 'appropriately'. It indicates something is positioned correctly or done appropriately. In its different forms, it can also convey a sense of correctness or suitability. For example, when used with verbs like istuma (to sit), it describes someone sitting in the proper position. When used before nouns, it modifies them to indicate appropriateness or correctness."
