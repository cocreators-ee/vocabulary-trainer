  "context": "The word 'inimese' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'inimene', which means 'human being' or 'person'. It indicates possession, relationship, or association with a person. In the nominative case (basic form), it would be 'inimene'. The genitive case often translates to English as 'of a human/person', 'belonging to a human', or simply shows connection without direct translation."
