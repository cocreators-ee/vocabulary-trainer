  "context": "The Estonian word 'sinult' is an elative case form of the personal pronoun 'sina' (you). It indicates movement or origin from someone, answering questions like 'kellelt?' (from whom?). This case is used when something comes out from someone or originates from them. The '-lt' ending is typical for elative case in Estonian."
