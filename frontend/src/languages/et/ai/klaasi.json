  "context": "The word 'klaasi' is part of the Estonian idiom 'klaasi põhja vaadata' which literally means 'to look at the bottom of a glass.' This phrase refers to drinking alcohol excessively or indulging heavily in alcoholic beverages. The expression suggests that someone drinks so much that they're looking at the empty bottom of their glass, implying consumption until it's completely empty. It carries a negative connotation and is often used when discussing problematic drinking habits or alcoholism."
