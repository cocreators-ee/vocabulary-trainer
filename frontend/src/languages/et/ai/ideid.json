  "context": "The word 'ideid' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'idee', which means 'idea'. In English, it translates to 'ideas' or 'thoughts'. The partitive case in Estonian indicates an incomplete amount or unspecified quantity, so 'ideid' could mean 'some ideas' or just 'ideas' depending on context. This form is commonly used when referring to multiple ideas without specifying the exact number."
