  "context": "The Estonian word 'ideid' is the plural genitive form of the word 'idea', which means 'ideas'. The '-id' ending indicates that it's in the plural form, and the extra 'd' at the end indicates the genitive case. In English translation, this would simply be rendered as 'ideas' without distinguishing between different cases."
