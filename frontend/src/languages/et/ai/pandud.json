  "context": "The word 'pandud' in this context appears to be part of the compound word 'aknaklaas' (window pane/glass) and is likely a form of the verb panna meaning 'to put' or 'place'. However, as a standalone word in the given dictionary definition, it seems to refer to a glass pane that has been placed or installed. The Estonian word 'pandud' is the past participle form of the verb 'panna', indicating something that has been put or placed somewhere."
