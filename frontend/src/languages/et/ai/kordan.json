  "context": "The Estonian word 'kordan' is the 1st person singular present form of the verb 'kordama', which means 'to repeat'. It can be used in various contexts: 1) doing something again or a second time, such as repeating exercises, tests, or musical pieces; 2) restating words, opinions, or questions that have already been said; 3) re-achieving previously attained results, like breaking records again; 4) being similar to something else in certain respects; and 5) plowing a field for a second time. The form 'kordan' specifically means 'I repeat' or 'I am repeating'. It's commonly used when someone wants to emphasize that they are restating something important, like deadlines, instructions, or questions."
