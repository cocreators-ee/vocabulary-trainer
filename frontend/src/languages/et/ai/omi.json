  "context": "In Estonian, 'omi' is the partitive plural form of the word 'oma', which means 'own'. It refers to parts or components that belong to something. The word 'oma' itself indicates possession or ownership, so when used in its partitive plural form as 'omi', it suggests portions or elements that are associated with or belonging to a larger entity."
