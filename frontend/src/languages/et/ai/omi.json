  "context": "The Estonian word 'omi' is a possessive pronoun that means 'one's own' or 'my own'. It indicates possession in the first person singular (I/my) and refers to something that belongs to the speaker. This word follows the Estonian grammatical structure for possessives, which often uses suffixes rather than separate words like English does."
