  "context": "In Estonian, 'uks' means a physical door that closes an entrance to a building or room. It can refer to the actual door structure or the opening it covers. The word has various forms depending on case: nominative 'uks', genitive 'ukse', partitive 'ust', illative 'uksesse', etc. Estonian uses different words for specific types of doors like 'auto|uks' (car door), 'kabiini|uks' (cabin door), or 'klaas|uks' (glass door). In figurative expressions, 'uks' can represent opportunities or access to something, as in 'avati ülikooli uksed' (the doors of university were opened) meaning gaining entry."
