  "context": "The word 'päevaga' is an Estonian expression used as a greeting, similar to 'Good day' or 'Have a nice day' in English. It literally translates to 'with the/day' but functions as a polite daytime farewell or greeting. The expression combines 'päev' (day) with the adessive case ending '-ga', indicating accompaniment or association - essentially saying something like 'with a good day'. This is commonly used when parting ways during daylight hours, often as a standalone phrase to wish someone well for the remainder of their day."
