  "context": "In Estonian, 'saatust' is the partitive form of 'saatus' (fate/destiny), but in this context it appears to be related to literature and drama as a component of 'epiloog'. The word refers to the concluding section of a literary work or dramatic piece that provides a summary and shows what happens to the characters later - their fate or destiny. It's essentially an epilogue that reveals the ultimate fate or destiny of the characters after the main story concludes."
