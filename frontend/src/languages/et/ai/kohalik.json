  "context": "The Estonian word 'kohalik' is an adjective meaning 'local' or 'native'. It refers to something, someone, or a characteristic that belongs to or originates from a specific place rather than being general or imported. The word can be used to describe people (local residents), things (local products), characteristics (local customs), or institutions that exist within a particular area but not more broadly."
