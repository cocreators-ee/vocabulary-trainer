  "context": "Oleksin is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'olema' (to be). It's used to express hypothetical situations, wishes, or conditions in the present or past. This is a first person singular conditional form, equivalent to English 'I would be'. The structure follows Estonian grammar where '-ksin' is added to the stem 'ol-' to create the conditional mood."
