  "context": "The Estonian word 'rohkemat' is the comparative form of 'palju' (much/many) and means 'more'. It's used to indicate a greater quantity or degree compared to something else. The '-mat' suffix forms the comparative in Estonian, similar to how English uses '-er' for comparatives like 'bigger' or 'more important'."
