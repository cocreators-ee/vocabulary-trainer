  "context": "In Estonian, 'neljas' is the ordinal form meaning 'fourth'. It indicates position in a sequence rather than quantity. This word is used when referring to something that comes in fourth place or has the number four as its position identifier. For example, it could refer to the fourth person, room, item, or any element in a series where order matters."
