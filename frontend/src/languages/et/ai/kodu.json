  "context": "The Estonian word 'kodu' primarily means home or dwelling place. It refers to a person's permanent living space with furnishings and often includes the family living there. The word can also be used more broadly to mean homeland, a habitat for animals, or an establishment providing accommodation (like a sailors' home). In everyday usage, it commonly appears in phrases describing moving to/from home, staying at home, or maintaining one's household."
