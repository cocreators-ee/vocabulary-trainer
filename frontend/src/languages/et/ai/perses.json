  "context": "The Estonian word 'perses' is a vulgar term that translates to 'butt,' 'ass,' or 'arse' in English. It can also be used as an intensifier meaning 'terrible' or 'awful', similar to saying something is 'screwed up' or 'completely messed up'. It’s considered impolite and should be used with caution."
