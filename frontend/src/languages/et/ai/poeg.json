  "context": "The Estonian word 'poeg' primarily means 'son' when referring to human male children. It can also mean 'offspring' or 'descendant' in the context of animals, and is used metaphorically for young plants or as poetic reference to representatives of a place, era, or nation. The word has several compound forms like 'esikpoeg' (first-born son) and 'õepoeg' (son of one's sister). In its genitive form 'poja', it appears in expressions indicating possession or relationship."
