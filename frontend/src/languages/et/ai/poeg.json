  "context": "The word 'poeg' is the nominative singular form of the Estonian noun meaning 'son'. It's a common kinship term referring to one's male child. In plural form, it becomes 'pojad', and in genitive case (possessive) it would be 'poja'. The word follows typical Estonian declension patterns for masculine nouns."
