  "context": "The Estonian word 'päriselt' is an adverb that means 'really', 'truly', or 'actually'. It's used to emphasize the truthfulness, genuineness, or intensity of what is being said. The word comes from 'päris' (real/true) with the '-elt' suffix indicating manner or way. In sentences, it modifies verbs or adjectives to add emphasis about how something truly is or was done."
