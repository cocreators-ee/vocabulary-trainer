  "context": "The word 'perset' is an Estonian interjection used to tell someone to be quiet or stop talking, expressing strong disapproval. It's particularly used in exclamations when someone has missed something or failed to do something that was expected of them. The term conveys annoyance and impatience with the person who didn't act earlier but is now speaking about it."
