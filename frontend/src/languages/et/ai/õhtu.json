  "context": "The Estonian word 'õhtu' has multiple meanings depending on context. Primarily, it means 'evening' - the end of the day, typically from about six o'clock until bedtime. It can also refer to 'dinner' (food eaten in the evening) or 'west' (the arc of the sky where the sun sets). From an etymological perspective, it comes from Proto-Finnic *ëktago and is cognate with Finnish ehtoo and Votic ohtogo. The word follows regular Estonian declension patterns with different forms in various grammatical cases."
