  "context": "In Estonian, 'õhtu' means evening or night. It's typically used to refer to the time period from late afternoon until nighttime. The word is in nominative singular form here. In different grammatical cases it would change: for example, 'õhtul' (on/at/in the evening), 'õhtule' (to/towards the evening)."
