  "context": "The word 'jätaks' is an Estonian verb form that would be the conditional mood (conditional tense) of the verb 'jätta', meaning 'to leave' or 'to put/place'. It indicates a hypothetical future action. The ending '-ks' marks this as the 3rd person singular conditional form, which translates to English as 'would leave' or 'would put'. This is used when talking about what someone would do under certain conditions."
