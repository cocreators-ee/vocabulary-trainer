  "context": "The word 'võtme' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'võti', which means 'key'. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case indicates possession or relationship, so 'võtme' would mean something like 'of a key' or indicate that something belongs to a key. It's not used as the main word but rather in possessive constructions."
