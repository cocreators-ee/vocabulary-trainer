  "context": "The Estonian word 'pilgu' appears to be related to the verb 'pilgutama' (to look/gaze) and is used in expressions where someone remains calm, composed, or unreactive. It often describes a state of not even moving one's eyes when something happens, suggesting extreme self-control or indifference. The word can also convey a sense of being cold-blooded or stoic in the face of provocation or pain."
