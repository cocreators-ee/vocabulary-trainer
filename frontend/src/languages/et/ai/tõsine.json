  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'tõsine' has multiple related meanings. It can describe someone who is serious in demeanor (not smiling or laughing easily), important matters that require attention, genuine/true characteristics, severe or dangerous situations, and significant efforts or challenges. The word appears to be derived from 'tõsi' (true) with the suffix '-ne'. Examples show it used to describe facial expressions, problems, people's character traits, illnesses, and difficult tasks."
