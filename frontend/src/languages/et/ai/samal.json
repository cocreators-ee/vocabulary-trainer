  "context": "The Estonian word 'samal' is the adessive singular form of 'sama', meaning 'same'. It's used to indicate location or time with the same thing, often translated as 'at the same time', 'on the same day', or 'similarly'. In the first sentence it means 'I can come at the same time'. The second shows working together on the same project. The third example indicates returning home on the same day."
