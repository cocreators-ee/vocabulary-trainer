  "context": "The Estonian word 'igavesti' is an adverb with multiple meanings: 1) eternally or forever (temporally endless), used in contexts like 'the world exists eternally'; 2) perpetually, constantly, or always, describing continuous states or actions as in 'ever-changing world'; and 3) very greatly or extremely, intensifying adjectives as seen in 'very old house' or 'very tired'. It derives from the root word 'igavene' meaning eternal."
