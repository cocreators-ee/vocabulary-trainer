  "context": "The Estonian word 'ettevaatlik' is an adjective that means careful, cautious, or wary. It's formed from the components 'ette vaatama' (to look out/watch out) plus the suffix '-lik', and serves as a calque of the German word 'vorsichtig'. The word describes someone who acts with caution and care to avoid potential dangers or problems. Its antonym is 'ettevaatamatu' (careless, reckless)."
