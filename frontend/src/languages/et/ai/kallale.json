  "context": "The Estonian word 'kallale' is a postposition and adverb with two main meanings: 1) indicating movement toward someone or something to attack, assault, or use force against (often translated as 'onto', 'against', 'upon'), and 2) indicating the beginning of an activity or work (translated as 'to', 'toward'). When used postpositionally, it takes the genitive case. As an adverb, it describes aggressive action toward a target."
