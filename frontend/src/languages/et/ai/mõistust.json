  "context": "The word 'mõistust' appears to be part of the phrase 'mõistust kaotama' which means 'to lose one's mind/reason'. In Estonian, this is used when someone becomes mentally unstable or irrational due to extreme emotions like fear, anger, grief, etc. The literal translation would be something like 'of reason/understanding', indicating the loss of rational thought."
