  "context": "The Estonian word 'uudistes' is the inessive case (locative case indicating location within) of the noun 'uudised', which means 'news'. It indicates that something is happening or exists 'in the news' or 'in news reports'. This form shows the plural nature of the word, as 'uudised' refers to multiple pieces of news. The '-des' ending is typical for the inessive case in Estonian grammar."
