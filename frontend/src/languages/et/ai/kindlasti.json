  "context": "Kindlasti is an Estonian adverb that means certainly, definitely, or surely. It indicates something that is without doubt or with absolute certainty. The word can be used to emphasize the truth of a statement or to express that something will happen for sure. It's often used in conversation as confirmation when asked if someone will do something (e.g., 'Kindlasti' meaning 'Certainly!' in response)."
