  "context": "The word 'lahingus' is an Estonian adessive case form of the noun 'lahing', meaning 'battle'. It indicates location or state during a battle, similar to how English uses prepositions like 'in' or 'during' with battles. The adessive case in Estonian typically answers the question 'where?' or 'in what state?', so 'lahingus' specifically means 'in battle' or 'during combat'. This form is used to describe where someone or something is located during a battle - they are 'in battle'."
