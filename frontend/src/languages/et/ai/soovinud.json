  "context": "The word 'soovinud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'soovima', which means to want, wish, or desire. It indicates a completed action in the past and is often used with auxiliary verbs like 'olen' (have) to form compound tenses. The form shown here suggests it could be from different persons depending on context, but typically would correspond to English constructions like 'have wanted/wished/desired'."
