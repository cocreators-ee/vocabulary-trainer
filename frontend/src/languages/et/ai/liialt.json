  "context": "The Estonian word 'liialt' is an adverb meaning 'too much', 'excessively', or 'overly'. It modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to indicate that something exceeds a normal or appropriate limit. For example, in the sentence 'Ta on liialt kurb', it means 'He/She is too sad'. The word comes from 'liiga' (too) and the suffix '-alt' which forms adverbs."
