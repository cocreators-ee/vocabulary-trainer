  "context": "\"Vot\" is an Estonian interjection used to express emphasis, surprise, or hesitation. It's similar to English filler words like \"well,\" \"then,\" \"but,\" or \"you know.\" The word often appears at the beginning of sentences and helps create a conversational tone. In different contexts, it can convey slight frustration, agreement, or serve as a transitional marker in speech."
