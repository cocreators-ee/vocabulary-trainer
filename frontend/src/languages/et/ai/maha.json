  "context": "The Estonian word 'maha' is a highly versatile adverb that primarily means 'down', 'off', or 'to the ground'. It can indicate physical downward movement (like putting something down), removal of clothing, falling to the ground, complete destruction, completion of an action, and even being left behind. Its meaning depends heavily on context - it might mean literally placing something down physically, taking off clothes, lying flat, finishing completely, or being eliminated from consideration."
