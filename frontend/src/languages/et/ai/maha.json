  "context": "The Estonian word 'maha' is a versatile adverb that indicates movement or position in a downward direction, removal from something, or departure to a different location. It can be translated as 'down', 'off', or 'away' depending on the context. For example, when used with verbs of motion like 'läksin' (went), it means 'down'. With verbs indicating placement or action on objects like 'panis raamatu maha' (put the book down/off), it indicates removal from a surface or position. When describing something stationary, as in 'auto seisab maha' (the car is parked), it can indicate being left behind or stopped."
