  "context": "The word 'sõidab' is the 3rd person singular present form of the verb 'soida', which means 'to drive' or 'to ride'. In this context, it specifically refers to a victory lap - when an athlete runs around the track/stadium after winning. It can be used for driving vehicles around in circles as well, but in sports contexts, especially with 'auringi' (victory lap), it means running/driving around the competition area in celebration of victory."
