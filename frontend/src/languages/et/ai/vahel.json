  "context": "The Estonian word 'vahel' has two main meanings. As a postposition, it means 'between' and indicates spatial or temporal relationships between objects, people, places, or time periods (e.g., 'between father and mother', 'between 10 and o'clock'). As an adverb, it means 'sometimes' or 'occasionally', indicating something happens from time to time but not regularly."
