  "context": "In Estonian, 'vahel' is an adverb that means 'sometimes', 'at times', or 'occasionally'. It's used to indicate that something happens intermittently or not on a regular basis. The word doesn't change its form regardless of the context it's used in - it remains 'vahel' whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. This is similar to how English uses 'sometimes' without conjugation."
