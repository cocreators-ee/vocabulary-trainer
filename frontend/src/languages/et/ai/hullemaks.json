  "context": "The word 'hullemaks' is the superlative form of the adjective 'halb' (bad) in Estonian. It means 'worse' or 'more bad' when comparing things that are at their most negative state. The '-ks' ending indicates this is an illative case form, often used to show transformation or change into a particular state. So it describes something becoming worse or reaching the worst possible condition."
