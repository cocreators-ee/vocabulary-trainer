  "context": "The Estonian word 'hädas' is an adessive case form of the adjective 'haige', which means 'sick' or 'ill'. However, in this context and based on the example sentences provided, it appears to be functioning as an expression meaning being in trouble, difficulty, or distress. The adessive case typically indicates location or state, so 'hädas' conveys being in a state of trouble or hardship."
