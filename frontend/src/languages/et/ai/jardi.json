  "context": "The word 'jardi' appears to be a shortened or colloquial form of the Estonian word 'jardi', which is likely related to 'päevä' (day) or possibly referring to weather conditions. In Estonian, 'päevä' means day or daytime. The word might be used informally in spoken language to refer to either the day itself or potentially as a colloquial term for weather conditions. It appears to be somewhat informal or dialectical rather than standard written Estonian."
