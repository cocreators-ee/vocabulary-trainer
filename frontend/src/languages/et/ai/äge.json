  "context": "The Estonian word 'äge' is a versatile adjective with multiple meanings depending on context. It can describe someone's temperament as fierce or irritable (ägeda loomuga), refer to something being sudden or sharp in development, indicate intensity of emotions or conflicts, or be used colloquially to mean 'awesome' or 'great.' In medical contexts, it means 'acute' (as opposed to chronic). The comparative form is 'ägedam' and the superlative can be 'kõige ägedam' or 'ägedaim'."
