  "context": "The word 'pole' is the negative form of the Estonian verb 'on' (is/are/am). It's used to express negation with singular and plural third person forms. 'Pole' is commonly used in everyday speech as a shortened form of 'ei ole', which literally means 'not is'. This contraction is very frequent in spoken Estonian and can be followed by adjectives, nouns, or other grammatical elements depending on what's being negated."
