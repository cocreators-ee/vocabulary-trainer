  "context": "The word 'pole' is a contraction of 'ei ole' in Estonian, which literally means 'not is/am/are/have'. It's the third person singular form of the negative verb used to negate existence or possession. In present tense, it's commonly used as the contracted form instead of the full 'ei ole'. The word can be translated into English as 'is not', 'am not', 'are not', or 'have not' depending on the subject and context."
