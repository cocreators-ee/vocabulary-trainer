  "context": "The word 'viimast' is the partitive case form of 'viimane', meaning 'last' or 'final'. It typically refers to something that comes at the end, either in sequence (the last one) or in importance (the final/ultimate). In Estonian, this would be used when referring to the last item(s) in a group, the final stages of something, or the ultimate sacrifice/contribution. The partitive case indicates it's talking about some amount or portion of 'lastness' rather than the complete concept."
