  "context": "The Estonian word 'sündinud' is the past participle of the verb 'sündima', which means 'to be born'. It's used to indicate that someone or something has been born and typically follows the verb 'olema' (to be) in compound tenses. For example, 'Ma olen sündinud Tallinnas' means 'I was born in Tallinn'. The word is grammatically neutral but agrees with the subject it describes - singular for one person, plural for multiple people."
