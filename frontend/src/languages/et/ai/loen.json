  "context": "The word 'loen' is the 1st person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'lugema', which means 'to read'. It specifically translates to 'I read' in English. In Estonian, verbs have different conjugations based on person and number. The base infinitive form is 'lugema', but when conjugated for 1st person singular (I), it becomes 'loen'. This shows the vowel change from 'u' to 'o' in the present tense conjugation."
