  "context": "The word 'kütust' is the partitive case form of Estonian noun 'kütus', which means fuel. In Estonian, the partitive case is often used to indicate an unspecified amount or partial quantity of something. So 'kütust' literally translates to 'of fuel' or some fuel. It's commonly used when talking about needing fuel, adding fuel, or referring to fuel in a non-specific quantity context."
