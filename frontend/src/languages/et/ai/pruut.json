  "context": "The Estonian word 'pruut' has two main meanings: it can refer to a bride (a woman who is about to be or recently married) and can also mean girlfriend or fiancée. In its declension forms, 'pruudi' is the genitive case, 'pruuti' is partitive, and 'pruudid' is plural nominative. The word comes from Middle Low German 'brūt' ultimately derived from Proto-Germanic *brūdiz."
