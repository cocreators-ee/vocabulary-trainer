  "context": "The Estonian verb 'muretsema' has three main meanings: 1) to feel anxiety or concern about something (worry), as in when someone worries about their health; 2) to take care of or look after someone or something, typically used for responsibilities like a mother looking after her family; and 3) to obtain or acquire things, such as getting new furniture for an apartment. The verb is derived from 'mure' (care/worry) with the '-tsema' suffix that indicates an ongoing action."
