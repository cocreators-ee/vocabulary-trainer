  "context": "The word 'alanud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'alama', which means 'to begin' or 'to start'. In this case, it's in the partitive case and is used with the adverb 'juba' (already) to indicate that an action has already begun. The structure 'juba alanud' literally translates to 'already begun' and emphasizes that something has started earlier than expected or at a particular point in time."
