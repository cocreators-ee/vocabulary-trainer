  "context": "The Estonian word 'kurt' primarily means deaf or hard of hearing. It can be used both literally to describe someone who cannot hear well, and figuratively to describe someone who is unresponsive or indifferent to something (like advice, requests, etc.). As an adjective, it declines according to Estonian grammar rules with forms like 'kurdi' (genitive), 'kurti' (partitive), 'kurdiks' (translative), etc. In its literal sense, it describes a person's hearing impairment, while in figurative use, it indicates someone who chooses not to listen or pay attention to something."
