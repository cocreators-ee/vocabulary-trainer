  "context": "The Estonian word 'kurt' can function as both an adjective and a noun. As an adjective, it means 'deaf' or 'mute'. As a noun, it refers to a deaf person. The word is derived from the same root as the verb 'kurdama' (to be mute/to not speak). In Estonian, this word doesn't distinguish between deafness and muteness in the way English often does, so it can carry both meanings depending on context."
