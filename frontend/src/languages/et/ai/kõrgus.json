  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõrgus' has multiple meanings depending on context: it can refer to physical height or altitude (the distance from bottom to top, or from ground level), in athletics it means high jump, it can also refer to the towering heights of space/firmament, and historically it was used as a respectful term for monarchs and rulers. The word changes form based on case - e.g., genitive 'kõrguse', partitive 'kõrgust'."
