  "context": "The Estonian verb 'lööma' is highly versatile with multiple meanings depending on context. Its core meaning is to physically strike or hit something (like hitting a person, object, or musical instrument). It can also mean to defeat someone in sports or games, to produce sound by striking (like ringing bells), to cause sudden changes in state (like knocking something over), to start doing something suddenly (as in 'löömas käima' meaning to start walking), and in various idiomatic expressions. The verb has different forms including the present tense 'lööb', past tense 'lõi', and infinitive form 'lüüa'. It's commonly used in both literal and figurative contexts in Estonian."
