  "context": "The word 'paadi' is the partitive form of 'paat', meaning 'boat' in English. In Estonian, the partitive case is often used to indicate an object that is being acted upon or exists partially. So 'paadi' can mean 'of a boat', 'some boat', or refer to the concept of a boat in general when it's not the direct subject but rather what is being possessed, modified, or exists partially."
