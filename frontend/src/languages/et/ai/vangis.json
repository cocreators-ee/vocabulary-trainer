  "context": "The Estonian word 'vangis' is an adverb that means 'in prison' or 'incarcerated'. It can also be used more figuratively to mean 'confined', 'trapped', or 'immobilized'. In its literal sense, it refers to being physically imprisoned. Figuratively, it describes situations where someone is unable to move freely or escape from a situation, such as being trapped in a place (like a basement), under debris, or even metaphorically held captive by emotions, memories, or circumstances."
