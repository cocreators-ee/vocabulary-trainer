  "context": "The word 'täidetud' is the past participle form of the verb 'täita', which means 'to fill'. It describes something that has been filled, occupied, or completed. In Estonian, this adjective agrees with the noun it modifies in gender and number, though in this case as a past participle it would typically be used after the noun. It can refer to physical containers being filled, spaces being occupied, or even abstract concepts like time being 'filled' with activities."
