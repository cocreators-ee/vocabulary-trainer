  "context": "The Estonian word 'relvaga' is an adverbial form meaning 'armed' or 'with a weapon'. It's formed by combining the noun 'relv' (weapon) with the adessive case ending '-ga', which indicates possession, accompaniment, or means. In this construction, it functions as an adverb expressing how someone is equipped or in what manner they are acting - specifically that they have a weapon."
