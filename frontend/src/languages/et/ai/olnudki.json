  "context": "The word 'olnudki' is an Estonian adverbial phrase that combines the past participle 'olnud' (been) with the emphatic particle 'ki'. It expresses intensity or emphasis, similar to saying 'really been', 'indeed happened', or 'actually occurred'. In the dictionary definition provided, it's used in the expression 'nagu oleks kits sabaga löönud' which means 'as if struck with a cat's tail' - an idiom for something happening very quickly or disappearing without trace. The word carries emphasis and suggests that whatever was being discussed happened suddenly, completely, or emphatically."
