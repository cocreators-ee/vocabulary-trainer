  "context": "The Estonian word 'olnudki' is a combination of the past participle 'olnud' (meaning 'been' or 'having been') and the particle 'ki', which adds emphasis. It can be translated as 'has been', 'had been', or 'has indeed been' in English, depending on the context. The word emphasizes that something has definitely happened or was true."
