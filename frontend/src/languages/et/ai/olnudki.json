  "context": "The Estonian word 'olnudki' is a form of the verb 'olema' (to be) in the past tense. It emphasizes that something *already* was in a certain state or condition, often implying a sense of completion or inevitability. It’s similar to saying ‘had been’ or ‘indeed was’ in English, but carries a stronger nuance of already being so."
