  "context": "'Vaadades' is the Estonian present active participle of the verb 'vaadata', which means 'to look' or 'to watch'. It functions similarly to the English '-ing' form (present participle) and indicates that someone is in the process of looking at or watching something. This word form is commonly used as a dependent clause in Estonian sentences, often preceded by 'kui' (when) or used with other conjunctions."
