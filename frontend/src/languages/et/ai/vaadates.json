  "context": "The word 'vaadates' is the Estonian present participle form of the verb 'vaatama', which means 'to look' or 'to watch'. It functions as an adverbial participle indicating simultaneous action with the main verb. The '-des' ending is typical for active voice present participles in Estonian, and it's used to express that one action is happening while another action takes place."
