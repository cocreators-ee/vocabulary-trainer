  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'rutem' means 'faster' or 'quickly'. It is used to describe someone or something moving at high speed. The word appears in comparative form, indicating a comparison of speed - being faster than some reference point (often implied rather than explicitly stated). For example, 'ta jooksis rutem' would mean 'he ran faster [than someone/something]'."
