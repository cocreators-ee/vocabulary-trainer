  "context": "The word 'tõelise' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian adjective 'tõeline', which means 'true', 'real', 'genuine', or 'actual'. It indicates that something possesses authentic qualities or corresponds to reality. The genitive case shows possession or relationship, so when used in sentences, it would typically express something being connected to or possessing truthfulness/reality rather than directly modifying a noun like the nominative form would."
