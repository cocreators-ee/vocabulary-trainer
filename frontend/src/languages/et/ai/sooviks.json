  "context": "'Sooviks' is the third person singular conditional form of the verb 'soovima', which means 'to wish' or 'to want'. The -ks ending indicates this is a conditional mood, expressing hypothetical desires or preferences. It corresponds to English expressions like 'would like/want/wish'. In the dictionary example, it appears in the phrase 'ei sooviks sinu olukorras olla' (wouldn't wish to be in your situation), showing how it's used to express someone's preference not to experience a particular circumstance."
