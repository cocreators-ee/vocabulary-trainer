  "context": "The word 'sooviks' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'soovima', which means 'to wish' or 'to want'. It's used when expressing a desire or preference in the past or present conditional mood. The '-ks' ending indicates this is the conditional form, similar to how English uses 'would' + verb. This word typically appears with pronouns like 'ma sooviks' (I would like) or 'me sooviks' (we would like)."
