  "context": "The word 'jäätist' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'jäätis', which means ice cream. In Estonian, the partitive case is often used to express indefinite quantity or when an action affects only a portion of something. So 'jäätist' specifically refers to some amount of ice cream - you could be eating it, buying it, or having some of it."
