  "context": "Jätkake is the plural imperative form of 'jätkama' in Estonian, meaning 'to continue'. It's used when addressing multiple people to tell them to keep doing what they were doing. The word can be used for continuing activities (like work or studies), physical tasks (extending something by adding to it), or conversations. In the imperative form, it directly commands others to proceed with an action."
