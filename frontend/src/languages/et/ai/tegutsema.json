  "context": "The Estonian word 'tegutsema' primarily means to act or take action. It can refer to being actively involved in activities, performing tasks, functioning, or working. The verb has multiple contexts: 1) for humans and animals - describing when someone is active or engaged in some activity (e.g., 'Terve pere tegutses aias' - the whole family was active in the garden), 2) for organizations/institutions - referring to an organization functioning or operating (e.g., 'Koolis tegutsevad mitmed huviringid' - several hobby groups operate at the school). The word emphasizes being proactive rather than passive, and can be used with various prefixes to modify its meaning."
