  "context": "The word 'neile' is the allative plural form of Estonian pronouns, specifically from 'nad' (they) or 'need' (these/those). In English, it translates to 'to them' or 'for them'. The allative case indicates movement toward something or someone. When stressed in a sentence, the longer form 'nendele' is used instead."
