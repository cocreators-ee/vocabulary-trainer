  "context": "The Estonian verb 'vabandama' means to apologize, excuse oneself, or ask for forgiveness. It's used when someone wants to express regret for something they've done wrong, an offense caused, or simply wants to politely withdraw from a situation. The word comes from the root 'vaba-' meaning free/loose and '-dam-a' suffix indicating action/state. In different forms it can be 'vandan' (I apologize), 'vabandad' (you apologize), 'vabandab' (he/she apologizes), etc."
