  "context": "The Estonian word 'võlur' refers to a person who performs magic or miracles. It is used to describe wizards in fairy tales and fantasy contexts. The word can be modified with adjectives like 'tark' (wise), 'hea' (good), or 'kuri' (evil) to characterize different types of wizards. In its plural form 'võlurid', it refers to multiple wizards, as seen in the example about fairy tale characters."
