  "context": "Ning is a conjunction in Estonian that functions similarly to 'ja' (and), used primarily to connect repeated sentence members, coordinate clauses in compound sentences, and sometimes replace 'ja' when it appears nearby. It can also appear in established word pairs, occasionally with contrasting meaning. It's commonly used where 'ja' would be expected but provides stylistic variation."
