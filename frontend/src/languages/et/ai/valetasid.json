It specifically addresses one person informally (you) and indicates that they lied in the past. This word appears in contexts where someone has not told the truth or provided false information. The dictionary entry shows it being used in a sentence where someone is acknowledging a falsehood: 'Pean nentima, et sa valetasid' which translates to 'I must admit/acknowledge that you lied.'"
