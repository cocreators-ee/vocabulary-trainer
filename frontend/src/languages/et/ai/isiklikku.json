  "context": "The word 'isiklikku' is the partitive case form of 'isiklik' which means personal/private. When combined with concepts like 'naudingud' (pleasures), 'rahulolu' (satisfaction), or 'rõõm' (joy), it refers to individual or private enjoyment that one seeks for themselves rather than shared with others. This relates to the epicurean philosophy of pursuing personal pleasure and sensory experiences."
