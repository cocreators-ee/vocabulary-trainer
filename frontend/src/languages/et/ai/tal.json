  "context": "The Estonian word 'tal' can function as a third person singular verb form meaning 'has' or 'possesses', but it also appears in compound verbs where it means 'to endure,' 'to bear,' or 'to suffer.' In its main usage as 'has,' it follows the subject and precedes the object. When used in compound forms like 'taluma' (to endure), it functions as a verbal component indicating endurance or tolerance of something difficult or unpleasant."
