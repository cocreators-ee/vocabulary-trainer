  "context": "The Estonian word 'tal' is primarily used as a postposition (adessive case) to indicate location in front of something or someone, spatial or temporal position before something, or presence in front of. It can show physical positioning, chronological order, social hierarchy, or relationship to people and objects. When stressed, the more emphatic form 'temal' is used instead."
