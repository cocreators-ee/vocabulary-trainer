  "context": "The word 'keri' in Estonian refers to a sphere or ball shape. It's used both for physical objects (like balls, spheres) and as a metaphor for round things. In geometric terms, it specifically refers to the mathematical concept of a perfect sphere where all points are equidistant from the center. The word can be found in compound words like 'juustukera' (cheese ball), 'karvakera' (fur ball), or 'lõngakera' (ball of yarn). It's also used to describe someone curling up into a ball shape, as in animals curling up to sleep."
