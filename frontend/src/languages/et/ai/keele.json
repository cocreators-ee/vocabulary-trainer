  "context": "In Estonian, 'keele' is the partitive form of 'keeled', which means 'languages'. The word 'keel' (without the final 'e') is the nominative/subject form meaning 'language' or 'tongue'. When it appears as 'keele', it typically indicates possession or association - for example, 'tema keele' would mean 'his/her tongue' in a physical sense, but can also refer to language ability. The partitive case often indicates partialness or relatedness rather than the whole thing itself."
