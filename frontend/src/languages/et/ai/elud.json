  "context": "The word 'elud' is the plural genitive case form of 'elu', which means 'life'. In Estonian, this case indicates possession or association - so 'elude' would mean 'of lives', 'of existences', or 'of life spans'. It's used when talking about things that belong to or are associated with multiple lives."
