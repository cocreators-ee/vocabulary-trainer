  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'omavahel' means 'with each other', 'among themselves', or 'mutually'. It indicates an action, state, or relationship that exists between people or things in a reciprocal manner. The word combines 'oma' (own) with 'vahel' (between), literally meaning 'between own ones'. This adverb is commonly used to describe interactions, relationships, comparisons, or distributions happening among a group without external involvement."
