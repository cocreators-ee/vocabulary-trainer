  "context": "The Estonian word 'omavahel' is an adverb that means 'between themselves' or 'among each other'. It indicates reciprocal action or interaction where a group of people are doing something with or to members of their own group. The word combines 'oma' (one's own) and 'vahel' (between), literally translating to 'between one's own'. It is used when emphasizing that the action happens within a specific group rather than with outsiders."
