  "context": "The Estonian word 'nahk' has multiple meanings: 1) The outer protective layer of the body in humans and animals (English: skin), including descriptions like smooth, elastic, soft, dry, normal, dark skin. 2) Animal hide that has been processed for use as material (English: leather). 3) In cooking, a thin film or coating that forms on liquids like soups or puddings when they cool. 4) Figuratively used to refer to a person's body or character ('oma nahk' means one's own skin/body), and in some contexts can describe someone as very thin or poor quality."
