  "context": "The Estonian word 'eli' is used as an adverb to describe actions that are done without purpose or benefit. It modifies verbs to indicate that the action serves no useful function and could have been avoided. In the examples, it appears in contexts where someone questions why something was done when it achieves nothing ('soota eli kulutada' - needlessly spend) and describes a state of being tired from pointless activities ('soota vaevasta väsinud' - tired from useless effort)."
