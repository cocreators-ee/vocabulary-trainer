  "context": "The Estonian word 'ühed' is the plural form of the numeral 'üks' meaning 'one'. When used in plural form as an indefinite pronoun, it refers to some unspecified members of a group. It's similar to English 'some' or 'one (of many)' when referring to non-specified individuals from a larger set. For example, 'ühed suvitajad' means 'some vacationers', referring to an unspecified subset of people who are on vacation."
