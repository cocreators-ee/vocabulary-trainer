  "context": "In Estonian, 'mängin' is the first person singular form of the verb 'mängima' meaning 'to play'. However, in this specific context from a literary source, it appears to be used idiomatically or dialectally to mean mocking or making fun of someone. The sentence suggests that the speaker has been 'playing with/mock' an unmarried widow for a long time, causing the whole village to laugh and consider the speaker somewhat foolish or silly."
