  "context": "The Estonian word 'teadlane' comes from 'teadma' (to know) and the suffix '-lane' which indicates a person associated with something. It refers to a scientist or someone engaged in scientific research. The word can be used for various specialists in different fields as shown by the numerous compound words like 'keemia teadlane' (chemist) or 'loodus teadlane' (naturalist). In Estonian grammar, it follows specific declension patterns with genitive form 'teadlase', partitive 'teadlast/teadlasi', and plural nominative 'teadlased'."
