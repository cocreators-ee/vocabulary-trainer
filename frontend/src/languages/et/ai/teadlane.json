  "context": "The word 'teadlane' is an Estonian noun that refers to a person who engages in scientific research or study. It is formed from the root word 'teadus' (science) with the suffix '-lane' which denotes occupation or profession, similar to how English forms words like 'musician' or 'politician'. This term can be used for scientists in any field of science."
