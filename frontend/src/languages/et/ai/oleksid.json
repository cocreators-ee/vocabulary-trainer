  "context": "Oleksid is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'olema' (to be). It appears in two forms: second-person singular conditional ('you would be') and third-person plural conditional ('they would be'). The word indicates a hypothetical or unreal situation - what someone or something would be under certain conditions. In the dictionary definition, it's used in the context of describing how 'culture bearers' (kultuurtreegerid) would have spread higher culture if they had been present."
