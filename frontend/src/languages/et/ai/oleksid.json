It specifically refers to the second person singular conditional mood, meaning \"you would be\" or \"if you were\". This form is used in hypothetical situations, wishes, or polite suggestions. The word combines the stem \"ole-\" with the suffix \"-ksid\" which indicates the conditional mood and second person subject."
