  "context": "The Estonian word 'nägu' means 'face' in English. It refers to the front part of a person's head, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and other facial features. In Estonian, it's a neuter noun that can be used to describe someone's appearance or expression. For example, 'ilus nägu' means 'beautiful face', and 'tume nägu' means 'dark/dull face'. The word can also appear in the partitive case as 'nägu' when talking about parts of a face, such as 'silmanägu' (eye area) or 'suunägu' (mouth area)."
