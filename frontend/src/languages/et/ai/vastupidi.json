  "context": "The Estonian word 'vastupidi' is an adverb that means 'opposite' or 'in the opposite direction'. It can be used both literally (for physical directions) and figuratively (when describing situations contrary to expectations). The word breaks down as 'vasti-' (against, opposite) + '-pide' (direction), indicating its core meaning of being positioned against or in opposition to something else. When used with the genitive case ('vastupidi millelegi'), it indicates opposition to something specific."
