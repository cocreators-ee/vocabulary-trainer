  "context": "Vastupidi is an Estonian adverb that means 'opposite', 'contrary', or 'in reverse'. It's used to describe something that happens in a completely different way than expected, planned, or previously stated. The word can indicate opposition to expectations, plans, or previous statements. For example, when someone says something is done 'vastupidi', it means the result was contrary to what was intended or predicted."
