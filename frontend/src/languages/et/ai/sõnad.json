  "context": "'Sõnad' is the nominative plural form of the Estonian noun 'sõna'. It refers to multiple words or terms. In Estonian grammar, when a noun appears in its plural form, it indicates more than one of something. The singular form 'sõna' means 'word', so 'sõnad' literally translates to 'words'. This form is used when referring to multiple words together, as components of language, speech, or text."
