  "context": "The word 'kohtume' is the first person plural form of the Estonian verb 'kohata', which means to meet or encounter. It literally translates to 'we meet'. This is commonly used when making plans to see someone again, similar to how English speakers might say 'Let's meet' or 'See you later'. The word appears in contexts where people are arranging meetings or saying goodbye with the expectation of meeting again."
