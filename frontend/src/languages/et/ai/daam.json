  "context": "In Estonian, 'daam' refers to an intelligent woman with good manners and refined taste. It can mean a lady in general, but specifically implies elegance, sophistication, and proper behavior. The term is used both for older respectable women and more broadly for any woman who conducts herself like a true lady. In social contexts like dances or formal occasions, 'daam' refers to a man's female partner."
