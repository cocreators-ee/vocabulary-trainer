  "context": "The Estonian word 'hall' has three distinct meanings: 1) As a noun, it refers to frost - the layer of ice crystals that forms on surfaces when temperatures drop below freezing. This is the most common meaning and appears in examples about spring/fall frosts damaging plants or describing morning frost on the ground. 2) As an adjective, it means grey (the color). 3) It can also refer to a large room or building (a hall), borrowed from German."
