  "context": "In Estonian, 'hall' is an adjective that means gray or grey. It's used to describe colors and can also refer to dull weather conditions. The word doesn't change form in these examples as it's in its basic nominative singular form. In Estonian grammar, adjectives typically agree with the noun they modify in gender, number, and case."
