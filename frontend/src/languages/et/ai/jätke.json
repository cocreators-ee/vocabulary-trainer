  "context": "In biological context, 'jätke' refers to a protruding structure or extension. It's commonly used in anatomy and botany to describe appendages like nerve processes (axons) on neurons, finger-like projections on elephants' trunks, or bristle-like structures on certain plant seeds. The word appears in plural form as 'jätketest' (from/in the processes/protrusions) and can be modified with descriptive adjectives."
