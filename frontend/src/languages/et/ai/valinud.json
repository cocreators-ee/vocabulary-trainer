  "context": "The word 'valinud' is the past tense/participle form of the Estonian verb 'valida', which means to choose, select or pick. It indicates that an action of choosing has already been completed in the past. In the provided dictionary example sentence 'Ta ei valinud teed ega hoidunud porilompidest,' we can see it used with a negative construction showing someone did not choose a particular path. This word specifically refers to the result of a selection process that has already occurred."
