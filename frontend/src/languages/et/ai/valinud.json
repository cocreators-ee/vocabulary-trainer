  "context": "'Valinud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'valida', which means 'to choose', 'select', or 'pick'. It indicates that an action of choosing has been completed in the past. In Estonian, past participles are used to form perfect tenses and can also function as adjectives. The word agrees with the subject it refers to in terms of number (singular/plural) but not gender since Estonian doesn't have grammatical gender distinctions."
