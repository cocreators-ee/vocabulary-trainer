  "context": "In Estonian, 'jagu' is a noun that refers to a small piece or portion of something. It's commonly used when talking about dividing food into smaller portions, taking just part of something larger, or indicating the end or completion of a quantity. The word can be found in various contexts from everyday conversations about sharing food to more abstract concepts of having 'enough' of something."
