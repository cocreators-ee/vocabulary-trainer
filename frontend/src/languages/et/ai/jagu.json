  "context": "The Estonian word 'jagu' has multiple meanings: it can refer to a share or portion of something (like food or problems), an amount or quantity, or a section/division (of a book, military unit, etc.). It's commonly used in contexts where things are divided into parts or sections. In its different grammatical forms like 'jao' (genitive) and 'jaod' (plural), it maintains the core meaning of division or portioning."
