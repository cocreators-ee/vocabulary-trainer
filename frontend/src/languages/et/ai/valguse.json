  "context": "The word 'aknad' is the plural form of 'aken', meaning window. It refers to the framed glass openings in walls or ceilings that allow light and air into buildings, vehicles, etc., as well as the frames themselves. Windows can be high, spacious, wide, large, low, small, narrow, pointed-arched, round-arched, double-hung, opening inward/outward, corner windows facing garden/street, etc. The word is also used metaphorically for openings in computer displays (windows/icons) and figuratively for breaks between classes or gaps without plants in water bodies."
