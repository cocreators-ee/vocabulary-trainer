  "context": "The word 'sulle' is the Estonian allative singular form of the pronoun 'sa', which means 'you' in informal speech. It's used to indicate direction or purpose toward someone, equivalent to English 'to you' or 'for you'. The Wiktionary definition notes that when stressed, 'sinule' (from 'sina') is used instead, but 'sulle' is the unstressed form commonly used in sentences."
