  "context": "In Estonian, 'sulle' is the allative case form of the pronoun 'sina' (you). It indicates direction or movement toward someone, similar to English prepositions like 'to', 'for', or 'at'. The allative case answers the question 'kuhu?' (where to?). This form is used when something is going to, intended for, or located at the person being addressed. For example, 'anna sulle' means 'give it to you', showing that the action of giving is directed toward the listener."
