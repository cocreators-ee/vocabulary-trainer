  "context": "The word 'aega' is the partitive form of 'aeg', which means 'time'. It's used when talking about an amount or duration of time, as in 'how much time do you have?' or 'I've been here for a while.' In Estonian, this case form appears after prepositions like 'pärast' (after) and 'enne' (before), and is commonly used in questions asking about time availability."
