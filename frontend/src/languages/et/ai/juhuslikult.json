  "context": "The word 'juhuslikult' is an adverb in Estonian that means accidentally, by chance, randomly, or coincidentally. It describes something happening without intention or planning, often as a result of luck or coincidence. The word comes from the noun 'juhus' (chance, accident) and the suffix '-likult' which forms adverbs meaning 'in the manner of'. So literally it means 'in a chancy/accidental way'. It's commonly used to express that something happened unexpectedly without deliberate planning."
