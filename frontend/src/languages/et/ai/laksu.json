  "context": "The word 'laksu' is an Estonian verb that appears to be a conjugated form of the verb 'minema' (to go). In this case, it seems to be in first person singular present tense ('minä laksen') or third person singular present tense ('hän laksen'). However, the standard Estonian conjugation for 'minema' in first person singular present is usually 'lähen', so this might be a dialectal form or an alternative conjugation. The word can mean 'I go' or 'he/she goes' depending on context."
