  "context": "The Estonian word 'näinud' is the past active participle and past connegative form of the verb 'nägema', meaning 'to see'. It functions as an adjective or adverbial participle indicating that someone has seen something. The word derives from the root 'näi-' which relates to visual perception, similar to how English uses '-ed' participles like 'seen' from 'see'. In Estonian grammar, it can be used in compound tenses or as a standalone descriptor of someone who has witnessed an event."
