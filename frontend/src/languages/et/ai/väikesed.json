  "context": "The word 'väikesed' is the plural form of the adjective 'väike', meaning 'small' or 'little'. It's used to describe multiple things as being small in size or quantity. In Estonian, adjectives agree with nouns in number and case, so '-d' ending indicates this is the plural nominative form."
