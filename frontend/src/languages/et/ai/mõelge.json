  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõelge' is the plural imperative form of 'mõelda' (to think). When combined with 'halvasti' (badly), it forms an expression that means 'don't think badly of me/each other'. It's a request not to judge someone negatively or have poor opinions about others. This phrase appears in the dictionary example 'Ärge mõelge minust halvasti' (Don't think badly of me)."
