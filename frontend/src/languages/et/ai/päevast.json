  "context": "The Estonian word 'päevast' is in the elative case, which indicates movement away from or origin. It's formed by adding '-st' to the basic word 'päev' (day). This form typically means 'from the day,' 'since morning,' or 'starting from today.' In sentences, it often appears with verbs indicating movement, duration starting from a certain time, or beginning of an action."
