  "context": "The Estonian word 'päevast' is an adverbial form derived from the noun 'päev' (day). It typically indicates temporal origin or starting point, meaning 'from the day', 'since the morning', or 'henceforth'. The '-st' suffix in Estonian often denotes separation, origin, or starting point. This word would commonly be used at the beginning of a sentence to indicate when something starts or from what time period it is being considered."
