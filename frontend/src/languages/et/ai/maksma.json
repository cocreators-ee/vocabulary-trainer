  "context": "The Estonian verb 'maksma' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'to pay' for goods or services, 'to cost' in terms of price, 'to be worth' something valuable, or to cause the loss of something (as in paying with one's life). When used impersonally, it means 'to be needed.' The verb also has specific grammatical constructions such as requiring an allative case marker for indicating payment to someone or using 'eest + genitive' for payment for something. Examples include 'palka maksnud' (paid salary) and 'raamat maksab 80 eurot' (the book costs 80 euros)."
