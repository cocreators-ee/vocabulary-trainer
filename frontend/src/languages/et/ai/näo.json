  "context": "The Estonian word 'näo' is the genitive case form of 'nägu', meaning 'face'. In the genitive case, it expresses possession or association - so 'näo' would mean 'of the face' or 'belonging to the face'. It's commonly used in phrases like 'ilus näo' (beautiful face) where 'näo' modifies another noun. The word belongs to the declension paradigm of 'nägu' which has different forms in various grammatical cases."
