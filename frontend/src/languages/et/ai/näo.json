  "context": "The word 'näo' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'nägu', which means 'face'. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case indicates possession or belonging. So 'näo' translates as 'of a face' or 'belonging to a face'. It would be used in contexts like describing something that belongs to someone's face or characteristics related to someone's face."
