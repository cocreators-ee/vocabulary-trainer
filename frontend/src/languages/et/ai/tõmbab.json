  "context": "The Estonian word 'tõmbab' is the 3rd person singular present tense form of the verb 'tõmmata', which means 'to pull'. It can be used to describe the physical action of pulling something, or more figuratively to mean attracting attention or interest. The word follows Estonian conjugation patterns and agrees with the subject in number (singular here) and person (3rd person)."
