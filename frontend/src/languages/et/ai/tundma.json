  "context": "The Estonian verb 'tundma' is highly versatile, primarily meaning 'to feel' or 'to know'. It can express physical sensations (feeling touch, temperature, pain), emotions (feeling joy, sadness), mental states (knowing facts, recognizing people), and familiarity with places, subjects, or people. It's one of the most fundamental Estonian verbs covering both sensory perception and cognitive knowledge."
