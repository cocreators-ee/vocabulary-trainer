  "context": "The word 'aastaselt' is an Estonian adverb that indicates someone's age or when something happens at a certain age. It's formed from 'aasta' (year) with the suffix '-selt', which typically means 'from' or 'at'. In this case, it specifically functions as an adverbial expression meaning 'at the age of' or specifying the age at which someone did something. The word can be used with different numbers to indicate specific ages."
