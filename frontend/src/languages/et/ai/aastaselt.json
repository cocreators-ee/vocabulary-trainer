  "context": "The Estonian word 'aastaselt' is an adverb that can be translated as 'from the age of', 'at the age of', or sometimes 'annually'. It's formed from 'aasta' (year) with the '-selt' suffix which typically indicates a starting point or origin in time. When used with ages, it specifies when something starts happening at a particular age."
