  "context": "'sinusse' is the illative case form of 'sina' (you), meaning 'into you'. In this context, it appears in the phrase 'ei puutu sinusse', which means 'does not concern you' or 'doesn't involve you'. This construction uses the partitive case after the verb 'puutuma' (to touch/concern) to indicate that something is outside one's sphere of interest or responsibility."
