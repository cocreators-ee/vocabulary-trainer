  "context": "The Estonian word 'kusagilt' is an adverb meaning 'from somewhere' or 'from some place'. It's formed from the interrogative pronoun 'kust' (where/from where) and the suffix '-agilt', which indicates an unspecified location. This construction follows a common pattern in Estonian where question words are modified to indicate uncertainty or indefiniteness."
