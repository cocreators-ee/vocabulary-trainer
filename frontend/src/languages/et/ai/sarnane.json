  "context": "The Estonian word 'sarnane' is an adjective meaning similar or alike. It's the singular nominative form of the word and is used to describe things or people that have resemblance or likeness to each other. The comparative form would be 'samasarnane' (more similar) and the superlative 'k천ige sarnane' (most similar). When describing masculine subjects, it takes no ending; for feminine subjects it becomes 'sarnane'; and in plural it's 'sarnased'."
