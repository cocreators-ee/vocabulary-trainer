  "context": "The word 'ütlesin' is the first-person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'ütlema', which means 'to say' or 'to tell'. It is formed by adding the past tense suffix '-sin' to the root 'ütlet-'. This form would be used when you want to indicate that 'I said something' in the past. The stem 'ütlete-' comes from the Proto-Finnic word for speaking, and it's commonly used in everyday Estonian conversation."
