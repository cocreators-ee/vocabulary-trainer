  "context": "The word 'jõu' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'jõud', which means power, strength, or force. In English, it would correspond to concepts like physical power, mental strength, or applied force. The partitive case often indicates an incomplete or partial aspect of the noun, so in these examples, it might refer to having some amount of power, experiencing strength, or requiring force."
