  "context": "The word 'ellu' in Estonian is used as an adverb or particle meaning 'into life', 'into existence', or 'into being'. It typically follows the verb 'kutsuma' (to call/summon) and indicates that something is being brought to life, established, founded, or created. The structure is usually 'kutsuti ellu [something]' which means '[something] was called into being/founded/established'."
