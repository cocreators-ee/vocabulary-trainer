  "context": "The Estonian word 'ellu' is an adverbial form that means 'alive' or 'into life'. It's commonly used in the verb construction 'elama ellu', which means 'to survive' or 'to live through (a difficult situation)'. The word indicates successfully enduring a challenge, illness, or dangerous event and remaining alive afterward. In sentences, it often appears after the verb 'elama' to express survival against odds."
