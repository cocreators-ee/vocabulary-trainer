  "context": "'Annaks' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'anna', meaning 'to give'. It's used to express a hypothetical or polite request for giving something. The word specifically represents the third-person singular conditional form, which would translate as 'he/she/it would give' in English. In questions, it can be used to ask if someone would be willing to give something (e.g., 'Kas sa annaksid mulle oma telefon?' means 'Would you give me your phone?'). It's often employed for polite requests rather than direct commands."
