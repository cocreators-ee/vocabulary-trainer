  "context": "The Estonian word 'teie' is the formal plural second-person pronoun, equivalent to English 'you' when addressing multiple people formally or showing respect. It's used in situations where you would use 'vous' in French or 'Sie' in German - for formal relationships with individuals or when speaking to groups of people regardless of familiarity. Unlike the informal singular 'sina', 'teie' maintains distance and shows politeness."
