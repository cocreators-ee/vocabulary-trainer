  "context": "The word 'hirmu' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'hirm', which means fear or dread. In this case, it expresses possession or relationship to fear - 'of fear', 'belonging to fear'. It's commonly used in phrases where someone experiences or possesses fear. For example, 'mul on hirmu' means 'I have fear/I am afraid'. The genitive case in Estonian is used to express possession, relationship, and often the direct object of certain verbs."
