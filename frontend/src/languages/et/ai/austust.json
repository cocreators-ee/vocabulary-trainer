  "context": "The word 'austust' is the partitive case of 'austus', which means respect, honor, or admiration. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case often indicates partialness or an ongoing action. So 'austust' can be used when talking about showing some degree of respect, having a portion of respect, or referring to the concept of respect in a general sense."
