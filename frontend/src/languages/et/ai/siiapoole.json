  "context": "The Estonian word 'siiapoole' is an adverb and preposition that indicates movement toward or position on the speaker's side. As an adverb, it means 'in this direction' or 'toward here', describing something moving to where the speaker is located. As a preposition (often with partitive case), it means 'on this side of' when referring to spatial relationships relative to some reference point. The word contains 'sia-' meaning 'here' and '-poole' indicating direction, similar to how English uses '-ward' or '-wards'."
