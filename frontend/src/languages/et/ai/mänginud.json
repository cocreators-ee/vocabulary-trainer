  "context": "The word 'mänginud' is the past participle of the Estonian verb 'mängima', which means 'to play'. In this context, it appears to refer to a team or group that played (often used in sports contexts). The dictionary definition suggests it can also relate to performing or acting roles. It's formed by adding the '-nud' suffix to indicate completed action in the past tense."
