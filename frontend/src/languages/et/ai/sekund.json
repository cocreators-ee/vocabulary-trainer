  "context": "In Estonian, 'sekund' is a masculine noun that means 'second' as in the unit of time. It's commonly used when referring to short periods of time or precise timing measurements. The word comes directly from Latin 'secundus' meaning 'following' and is cognate with English 'second'. In usage, it can refer to both the time measurement and figuratively mean a brief moment or instant."
