  "context": "The word 'auku' is an adverb in Estonian that describes something as being sunken, hollowed out, or depressed. It's commonly used to describe facial features like eyes or cheeks that have become concave due to illness, age, or other factors. The word comes from the noun 'auk' meaning hole, and when used as 'auku', it indicates the direction of movement into a hollow state."
