  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuidas' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings. Its primary use is as an interrogative adverb asking about manner or way ('how'). It can also introduce clauses indicating method or means, be used in exclamatory questions and rhetorical expressions, indicate intensity of feelings or situations, serve as a concessive clause starter (meaning 'however' or 'no matter how'), and function as a comparative conjunction. The word appears to have derived from the interrogative pronoun 'kuid-', which likely relates to questioning/asking."
