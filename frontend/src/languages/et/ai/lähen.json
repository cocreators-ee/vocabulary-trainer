  "context": "\"Lähen\" is the first-person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb \"minema\", which means \"to go\". It indicates that the speaker is currently or will be performing the action of going somewhere. The word can translate to \"I go\" in simple present tense, \"I am going\" in present continuous, or \"I will go\" depending on context. In Estonian, this form does not change based on whether the action is immediate future or habitual - both are expressed with the same present form."
