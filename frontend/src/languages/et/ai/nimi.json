  "context": "The Estonian word 'nimi' means 'name' in English. It is a common noun used to refer to the name of a person, place, or thing. In its basic form 'nimi', it can be singular or plural depending on context, but typically appears as 'nimed' (names) when plural. For example, one might ask 'Mis on sinu nimi?' meaning 'What is your name?'. The word follows Estonian grammar patterns and is used in everyday conversations for introductions and identification."
