  "context": "The Estonian word 'ajavad' is the 3rd person plural form of the verb 'aja-' meaning to brush, stroke, or gently move something. It's commonly used for describing how animals like birds preen their feathers (linnud ajavad tiibu) or people brushing/fluffing hair (kanad ajavad end kohevile). The action involves gentle stroking movements rather than vigorous brushing."
