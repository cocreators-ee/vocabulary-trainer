  "context": "The Estonian word 'öeldud' is an adverbial form that means 'said' or 'spoken'. It's often used in conversational contexts to introduce additional comments, similar to English phrases like 'by the way', 'incidentally', or 'to be said'. The word can appear in various constructions such as 'muuseas öeldud' (by the way), 'olgu öeldud' (let it be said), and 'muide öeldud' (by the way/incidentally). It serves to mark information that is being added on as an afterthought or supplementary comment to the main conversation."
