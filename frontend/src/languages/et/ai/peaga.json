  "context": "The Estonian word 'peaga' is a postposition that indicates instrumentality or manner, meaning 'with the head' or 'using the head'. It shows how an action is performed - specifically using one's head as the tool or method. This form comes from the genitive case of 'pea' (head) combined with the postposition '-ga', which means 'with' in Estonian."
