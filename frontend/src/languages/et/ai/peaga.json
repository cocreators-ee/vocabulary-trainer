  "context": "The Estonian word 'peaga' is an adverbial form meaning 'with the head' or figuratively 'with determination/stubbornness'. It's commonly used to describe doing something head-on, persistently, or stubbornly despite potential difficulty or impossibility. The dictionary definition specifically mentions running against a wall metaphorically as a way of expressing this determined, almost reckless approach."
