  "context": "The Estonian word 'pähe' is a postposition that indicates something being done in place of, instead of, or as a substitute for something else. It emphasizes the substitution aspect and can sometimes imply mistake or deception. The dictionary examples show it being used to replace one thing with another - shooting a dog instead of a wolf, collecting poisonous mushrooms along with edible ones, drinking wine instead of water."
