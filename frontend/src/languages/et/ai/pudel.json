  "context": "The Estonian word 'pudel' means bottle. It refers to a container with a neck and a cap used for holding liquids like water, milk, wine, beer, or other beverages. The word can be modified by adjectives indicating the material (glass, plastic, aluminum), size (liter-sized, half-liter), or type of contents (wine bottle, beer bottle). It follows Estonian declension patterns with various cases like genitive (pudeli), partitive (pudelit), illative (pudelisse), etc."
