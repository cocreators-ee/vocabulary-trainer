  "context": "The word 'paika' in Estonian has multiple meanings depending on the context. It can be a colloquial form of the verb 'p채채sima' (meaning 'to go' or 'to reach'), particularly in informal speech. Additionally, it can refer to a place or location. In example sentences, it's used as both a verb ('Ma l채hen paika' - I'm going there) and a noun reference ('Paika on tore koht' - It's a nice place)."
