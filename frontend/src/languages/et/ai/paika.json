  "context": "The word 'paika' has two main meanings in Estonian. First, it's slang for a standardized food portion given to prisoners, particularly referring to bread portions or rations in labor camps. Second, it can be the partitive singular form of the word 'paik', which means 'place'. The prison context usage appears to be more common based on the dictionary definitions provided."
