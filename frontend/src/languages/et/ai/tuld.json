  "context": "The word 'tuld' is used in Estonian to describe a sudden flash or burst of sensation, typically associated with strong pain. It often appears in contexts where something strikes the body forcefully and causes an immediate, intense feeling that flashes through someone's eyes or senses. This could be from physical impact or extreme emotional distress."
