  "context": "The Estonian word 'arvatavasti' is an adverb that expresses probability or likelihood. It's used to indicate something that is likely true but not certain, similar to saying 'probably', 'likely', or 'I suppose' in English. This word is commonly used when making educated guesses or assumptions about situations where complete certainty isn't possible."
