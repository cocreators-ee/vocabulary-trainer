  "context": "The Estonian word 'arvatavasti' is an adverb that expresses probability or likelihood, similar to English words like 'probably', 'likely', or 'presumably'. It's used when something is expected or believed to be true but isn't certain. The word comes from the verb 'arvama' (to suppose/assume) combined with the suffix '-tavasti' which forms adverbs of probability."
