  "context": "The Estonian word 'armee' comes from German and means army. It can refer to a military operational unit composed of multiple formations and different branches of the armed forces, or more broadly to a country's armed forces (excluding naval forces), primarily ground troops. Figuratively, it can describe a large group of people sharing common characteristics. The word is masculine in gender and follows specific declension patterns in Estonian."
