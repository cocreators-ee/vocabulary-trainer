  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'niimoodi' means 'so', 'this way', or 'that way'. It is formed from the components 'nii' (meaning 'like this/that') and 'moodi' (meaning 'way/method'). This word indicates manner, method, or way of doing something. It can be used to describe how something should be done, how someone understood something, or to comment on a particular manner of speech or behavior. The word is not comparable in form."
