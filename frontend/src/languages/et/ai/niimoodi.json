  "context": "The Estonian word 'niimoodi' is an adverb that means 'like this', 'in such a way', or 'so'. It's used to describe how something is done or the manner in which something happens. The word combines 'nii' (meaning 'thus', 'so') with 'moodi' (meaning 'way'), so it literally means 'in this way'. It can be used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a description, in the middle to describe an action or manner, or at the end for emphasis. The word doesn't change form regardless of context."
