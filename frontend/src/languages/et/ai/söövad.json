  "context": "The word 'söövad' is the 3rd person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'sööma', which means 'to eat'. It describes what a group of people or animals are currently eating. The dictionary definition shows it used in the context of camels (kaamelid) eating Alhagi, a type of spiny shrub found in Eurasian deserts and steppes that is consumed by camels."
