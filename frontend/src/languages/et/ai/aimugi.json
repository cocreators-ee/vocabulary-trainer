  "context": "The Estonian word 'aimugi' is a colloquial expression used to indicate uncertainty or approximation in speech. It functions as an adverb meaning roughly 'I guess', 'I suppose', or 'I imagine'. The word comes from the verb 'aima' (to aim, to guess) with the '-gi' suffix which adds emphasis. In Estonian conversation, it's commonly used when someone wants to express that they're not entirely certain about something but have a reasonable assumption based on available information."
