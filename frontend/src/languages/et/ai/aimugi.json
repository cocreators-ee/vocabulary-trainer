  "context": "The word 'aimugi' is an Estonian adverbial expression that intensifies negation. It's derived from 'aimu' (clue, notion) combined with the particle '-gi' (also/either), and used in negative contexts to mean 'not even a little bit', 'absolutely not at all'. This expression typically appears after the verb 'pole' (is/are not) or similar negations. It's commonly used in spoken Estonian to emphasize complete lack of knowledge, understanding, or awareness about something."
