  "context": "The Estonian word 'sõdur' refers to a soldier or warrior, specifically a member of the armed forces. It can refer to regular soldiers in ranks like private and corporal within the Estonian Defense Forces. The word is also used more broadly to mean any military personnel. In addition to its primary meaning as a soldier, 'sõdur' can also refer to a jack card in playing cards (in games where the ranking is ace, king, queen, soldier, ten, etc.), and it's sometimes humorously applied to certain types of insects like termite soldiers or army ants."
