  "context": "The Estonian word 'endine' is an adjective that means 'former,' 'erstwhile,' or 'previous.' It refers to someone or something that was in a particular state or position previously but no longer is. The word changes form depending on case and number - it becomes 'endise' in genitive singular, 'endist' in partitive singular, and 'endised' in nominative plural. For example, 'endine õpetaja' means 'former teacher,' and 'endised õpilased' means 'former students.'"
