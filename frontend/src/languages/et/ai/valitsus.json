  "context": "In Estonian, 'valitsus' refers to the government or ruling body of Estonia. It is a common noun that can refer to either the national government as an institution, or specifically to the cabinet of ministers headed by the prime minister. The word derives from the verb 'valitsema' (to rule/govern) + the suffix '-sus' (state/condition), literally meaning 'the state of ruling'. It is used in formal and political contexts when discussing national governance."
