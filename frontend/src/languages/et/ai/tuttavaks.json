  "context": "The word 'tuttavaks' is the illative case form of 'tuttav', meaning familiar or known. When used with verbs like 'saama' (to get/become), it means to become familiar with something/someone, but in the context shown in the example sentences, it appears to be a reflexive construction where someone makes themselves known to others - essentially introducing oneself or making oneself acquainted with people. The illative case indicates movement into a state of being known/familiar."
