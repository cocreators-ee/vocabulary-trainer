  "context": "The Estonian word 'silmist' is an adessive case form derived from 'silma' (eye). It typically means 'from the eye' or 'from sight', indicating something originating visually or being perceived through sight. In English, it can be translated as 'from the eye', 'from sight', or more contextually as 'visually'. This form is used when describing something that comes from visual perception or escapes one's gaze."
