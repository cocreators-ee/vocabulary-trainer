  "context": "The Estonian word 'laiali' is an adverb that means something is spread out, scattered, or dispersed over a wide area. It can describe physical objects (like hands and legs being spread apart), things distributed across space (like summer houses on slopes), or people dispersing after an event. The word often implies movement from a concentrated state to a more widespread arrangement."
