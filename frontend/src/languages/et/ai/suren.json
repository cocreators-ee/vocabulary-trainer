  "context": "The word 'suren' is the first person singular present indicative form of the verb 'surnud', meaning 'to be dead' or 'to die'. In this case, it's likely a misspelling or misunderstanding of 'surnen' which would mean 'I am at home', but more commonly it refers to the verb 'surema' (to die) in first person present form: 'suren' means 'I die'."
