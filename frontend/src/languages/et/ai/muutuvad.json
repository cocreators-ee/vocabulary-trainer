  "context": "The word 'muutuvad' is the 3rd person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'muutuma', which means 'to change', 'to become', or 'to vary'. It describes something that is changing, becoming different, or transforming from one state to another. In physics contexts, it can refer to how straight lines transform into curved lines (as mentioned in the dictionary definition about aberration)."
