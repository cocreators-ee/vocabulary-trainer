  "context": "In Estonian, 'loa' is the partitive form of the noun 'lood', which means permission or license. It indicates having some amount of permission to do something. This word follows the standard Estonian grammatical pattern where the nominative singular would be 'lood' and in this case appears in the partitive case."
