  "context": "The Estonian word 'olukord' means a situation, condition, or state of affairs. It can refer to various types of circumstances - economic conditions, living situations, current states, or general states of affairs at a particular time. The word is formed from 'olu' (state) + 'kord' (time/occasion), literally meaning 'state-time'. It's commonly used in compound words like 'konfliktiolukord' (conflict situation) and 'sõjaolukord' (war situation)."
