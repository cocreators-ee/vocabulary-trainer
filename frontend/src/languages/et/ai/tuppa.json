  "context": "The Estonian word 'tupper' (and its imperative form 'tuppa') means 'to fall asleep' or 'to go to sleep'. It's commonly used in everyday speech when telling someone to go rest, similar to how we might say 'go to bed' in English. The verb implies the action of starting to sleep and is often used with children or when speaking casually."
