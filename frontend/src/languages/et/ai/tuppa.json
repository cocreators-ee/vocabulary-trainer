  "context": "The word 'tuppa' is the illative singular form of the Estonian noun 'tuba', meaning 'room'. The illative case in Estonian indicates movement into or towards a place. So 'tuppa' specifically means 'into the room' and is used when someone or something enters a space. It's formed by adding the illative ending '-a' to the stem of the word 'tuba'. This form would be used after verbs indicating movement like 'minema' (to go) or 'võtma' (to take)."
