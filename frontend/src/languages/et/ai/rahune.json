  "context": "The word 'rahune' is an adjective in Estonian that describes someone or something as calm, peaceful, or serene. It appears to be related to the root 'rahu' (peace) and likely indicates a state of tranquility, quietness, or lack of agitation. The example sentence from the dictionary shows it being used with '-sema' suffix to form 'rahusema', suggesting comparative form meaning 'calmer'. This word would typically describe someone's peaceful demeanor or a serene atmosphere."
