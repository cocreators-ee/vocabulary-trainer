  "context": "The word 'liigume' is the 1st person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'liikuma', which means 'to move'. In this form, it specifically translates to 'let's move', 'we are moving', or 'we go/move'. It expresses movement or locomotion in a general sense rather than referring specifically to jumping like its apparent root word might suggest."
