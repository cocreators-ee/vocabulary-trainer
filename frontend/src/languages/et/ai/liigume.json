  "context": "The word 'liigume' is the 1st person plural imperative form of the Estonian verb ' liikuma', which means 'to move'. It's used to suggest movement or relocation for a group including the speaker, similar to saying 'Let's move!' in English. The '-me' ending indicates it's an inclusive 'we' form where the speaker is included in the action being suggested."
