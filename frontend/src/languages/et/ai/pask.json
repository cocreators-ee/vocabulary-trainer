  "context": "The Estonian word 'pask' is a vulgar noun meaning excrement (crap, shit), filth, or something worthless. It's used literally for animal droppings and figuratively to describe unpleasant things or people. The word has various grammatical forms: nominative pask, genitive pasa, partitive paska. Example sentences show its use in contexts describing animals having bowel movements (hobusel on pask lahti - the horse's bowels have opened), animals being covered in manure (lambad on pasal - the sheep are in manure), and warnings to avoid stepping in it."
