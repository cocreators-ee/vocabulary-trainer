  "context": "The Estonian verb 'ajama' is a versatile word with multiple meanings. Its core meaning relates to causing something or someone to move in a particular direction, similar to 'driving,' 'pushing,' or 'urging forward.' It can be used both literally (physically moving objects or people) and figuratively (causing emotional states or situations). The verb appears in various contexts including driving vehicles, pushing animals/people, causing physical sensations like nausea or sweating, creating sounds, pursuing tracks, following certain behaviors, distilling alcohol, and even planting seeds. It's an important multi-purpose verb that captures the concept of forward movement or causation."
