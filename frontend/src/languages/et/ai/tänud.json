  "context": "The word 'tänud' appears to be an archaic or literary form used in Estonian, specifically as part of the compound adjective 'tuhandekordne' (which means 'thousandfold'). In the examples provided, it's used to describe something that has increased by a factor of one thousand. The word appears to be part of this larger expression rather than being used independently."
