  "context": "\"Arsti\" is the genitive singular form of the Estonian word \"arst\", which means \"doctor\" or \"physician\". In Estonian grammar, the genitive case typically indicates possession or relationship, so \"arsti\" can mean \"of a doctor,\" \"to a doctor,\" or \"from a doctor\" depending on the context. It's commonly used when saying you're going to see a doctor, referring to something belonging to a doctor, or indicating movement toward/from a doctor."
