  "context": "The Estonian word 'pealt' is an adverb that can mean several related things: 1) spatially - indicating position from above or on top of something, similar to English 'from above' or 'overhead'; 2) temporally - meaning 'afterward' or 'later'; 3) in the context of observation - meaning 'watching from the side' or 'looking on'. It often appears in phrases like tule pealt (come from above/via a different route), and is commonly used to indicate where someone is observing something from."
