  "context": "Tihti is an Estonian adverb that means 'frequently' or 'often'. It indicates how often something happens. The word can be used in various contexts to describe repeated actions, events, or occurrences. In some older texts, it could also mean 'densely' or 'closely', but its primary meaning today is about frequency. Examples include a child being frequently ill (laps on tihti haige), someone often being late for school (hilineb tihti kooli), and meeting someone often (kohtume temaga tihti)."
