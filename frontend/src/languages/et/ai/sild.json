  "context": "The Estonian word 'sild' primarily means a physical structure that spans across water or other obstacles to allow passage, such as a bridge. It can also refer to a spiritual connection between people, ideas, or cultures (cultural bridge). In technical contexts, it has specialized meanings like the wheel axle of a vehicle, part of a ship's navigation deck, dental prosthesis, brain anatomy (pons), and gymnastics position (backbend). The word comes from Proto-Finnic origins with cognates in related Finno-Ugric languages."
