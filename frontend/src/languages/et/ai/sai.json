  "context": "The word 'sai' has two main meanings in Estonian: 1) As a noun, it means 'white bread', referring to traditional white bread that was often made for special occasions like weddings. The word can also refer to various types of pastries or baked goods. It's used in both singular and plural forms (sai/saiad). 2) As a verb form, 'sai' is the third-person singular past indicative of 'saama', meaning 'got' or 'received'. In this context, it would appear in sentences like 'Ta sai kingituse' (He got a present)."
