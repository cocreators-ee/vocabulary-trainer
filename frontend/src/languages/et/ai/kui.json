  "context": "The word 'kui' in Estonian is a versatile conjunction that can function as 'when', 'if', or 'as long as' depending on the context. It introduces temporal clauses (time relationships) or conditional clauses (hypothetical situations). For example, it can indicate timing ('When you came?'), conditionality ('If we have time'), or duration ('As long as we have time')."
