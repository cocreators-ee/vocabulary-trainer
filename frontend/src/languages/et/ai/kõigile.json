  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõigile' is the allative case of 'kõik', meaning 'everyone' or 'all'. It indicates movement toward or direction to everyone. The word combines the root 'kõi-' (all) with the suffix '-le' which indicates direction or movement toward something or someone. In English, it translates to phrases like 'to everyone', 'for all', or 'to everybody'. It's commonly used in greetings, announcements, or when addressing a group of people."
