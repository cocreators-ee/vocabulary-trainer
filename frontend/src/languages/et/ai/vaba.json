  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaba' is a versatile adjective that primarily means 'free', but has many nuanced uses depending on context. It can describe independence (political or personal), lack of constraint, availability, being untaken, not restricted, and even cost-free. The word appears in many compound forms like 'alkoholvaba' (alcohol-free) and has different forms for singular/plural, comparative (vabam), and superlative (kõige vabam)."
