  "context": "The word 'vanamees' in Estonian is a compound word consisting of 'vana' (old) and 'mees' (man). It refers specifically to an elderly or old man. This term can be used both neutrally and with some respect, though context may affect the connotation. The word combines age ('vana') with gender ('mees'), making it a specific descriptor for male elders rather than just any older person."
