  "context": "The word 'vanamees' in Estonian has multiple meanings depending on context. Its primary meaning is 'old man' or 'elderly man.' It can also be used colloquially to refer to one's husband ('meessoost abikaasa, mees') or father ('isa'). In some contexts, it may even refer metaphorically to a large male animal like a bear. The word combines 'vana' (old) with 'mees' (man), literally meaning 'old man.'"
