  "context": "The word 'nendest' is the elative plural form of the Estonian demonstrative pronoun 'need'. It means 'from these', 'out of these', or 'about these'. In English, it's often translated as 'about these', 'concerning these', or simply 'of these'. The elative case indicates movement away from something or source/origin. When used with plural nouns, it refers to a group of things the speaker is talking about."
