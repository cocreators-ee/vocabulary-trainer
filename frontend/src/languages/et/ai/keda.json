  "context": "The word 'keda' is the partitive form of the Estonian pronoun 'kes' (who/whom). It functions as the object of a sentence when asking about or referring to a person. In grammatical terms, it's used in both singular and plural partitive cases. The dictionary definition shows it can also be used with negation patterns like 'mitte keda kuraditki' meaning 'not anyone at all'."
