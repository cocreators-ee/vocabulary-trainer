  "context": "The Estonian word 'hetkeks' is an adverbial form used to indicate a short duration or temporary state. It's derived from the noun 'hetk' (moment, instant) with the suffix '-eks', which transforms it into an illative case form meaning 'into a moment' or effectively functioning as 'for a moment'. This construction is commonly used in Estonian to express that something happens for a brief period of time."
