  "context": "The Estonian word 'juht' has multiple related meanings. It can refer to a person who leads, directs, or guides others (such as a political leader, artistic director), a driver of vehicles (like car drivers, tram operators), or someone showing the way (a guide). In physics, it also means a conductor that transmits electricity, heat, or sound. The word is cognate with Finnish 'johtaa' meaning to lead."
