  "context": "The word 'baari' is the partitive singular, genitive singular, and illative singular form of the Estonian noun 'baar'. In Estonian grammar, these different cases are used to indicate grammatical relationships in sentences. As a measurement term, 'baari' refers to a millibar (mbar), which is a unit of pressure equal to one thousandth of a bar. It can also be found in meteorological contexts where atmospheric pressure is measured."
