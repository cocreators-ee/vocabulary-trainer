  "context": "The Estonian word 'valge' has multiple meanings: 1) It means the color white, describing things that are white like snow, milk, or paper; 2) It can mean something is covered with snow; and 3) It can describe something as being light, bright, or illuminated. As an adjective, it changes form in different cases (valge, valgete, valgesse etc.). In historical/political contexts, it refers to the counterrevolutionary White movement during wars."
