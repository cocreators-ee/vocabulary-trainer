  "context": "The word 'liig' is an Estonian adjective that means something exceeds the normal measure, being excessive or surplus. It indicates when something goes beyond what is appropriate, necessary, or normal - whether talking about physical objects (like too long dress), quantities (excessive amount of something), or even abstract concepts (too much noise, too many requests). In different grammatical forms it can appear as 'liig', 'liiad' (plural), 'liias' (inessive case meaning 'in excess'), etc."
