  "context": "The word 'koer' is the Estonian noun for 'dog'. It's in nominative singular form. In Estonian, nouns decline according to case, so this would change in different grammatical contexts - for example, 'koera' (partitive singular), 'koeri' (genitive plural), etc. Dogs are common pets in Estonia and the word is used daily when referring to dogs."
