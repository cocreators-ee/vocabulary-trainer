  "context": "The Estonian word 'koer' primarily means a domesticated dog (Canis familiaris), but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people. As an adjective, it describes someone who is unruly or has gone too far. The word appears in numerous compound words describing specific types of dogs, like jahikoer (hunting dog) or politseikoer (police dog)."
