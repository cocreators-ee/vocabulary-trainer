  "context": "In Estonian, 'ära' is a highly versatile word with multiple functions. As an adverb, it means 'away', indicating movement from one place to another (e.g., 'Mine ära!' meaning 'Go away!'). It also serves as the second-person singular imperative form of the negative verb 'ei', equivalent to 'do not/don't'. Additionally, when combined with other verbs, it forms perfective aspects, emphasizing completion or result of an action. The word can indicate removal from a location, separation from something, or completion of various actions."
