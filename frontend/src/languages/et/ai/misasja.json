  "context": "Misasja is an Estonian colloquial expression used instead of the pronoun 'mis' (what) in partitive case. It's a dialectal or informal form that appears in literary works to represent spoken language. The word combines 'mis' (what) with '-asja' (a thing/matter), essentially meaning 'what kind of thing' or 'what is it'."
