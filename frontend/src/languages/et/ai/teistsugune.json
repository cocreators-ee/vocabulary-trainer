  "context": "The Estonian word 'teistsugune' is an adjective that means 'different' or 'unusual'. It's formed from 'teine' (meaning 'second' or 'other') and the suffix '-sugune' which indicates a type or kind. The word describes something that is not like others, has distinctive characteristics, or stands out from the norm. In Estonian grammar, this adjective would typically agree in number and case with the noun it modifies."
