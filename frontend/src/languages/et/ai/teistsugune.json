  "context": "The Estonian word 'teistsugune' is an adjective that means 'different' or 'other'. It's formed by combining 'teine' (other) + 'sugu' (genus, stock, kin) + '-ne' (adjective suffix). The word indicates something that differs from what was previously known, expected, or mentioned. It can be used to describe people, things, situations, or qualities that are not the same as others or compared to a previous state."
