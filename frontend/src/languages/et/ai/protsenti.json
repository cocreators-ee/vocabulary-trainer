  "context": "The word 'protsenti' is the partitive form of 'protsent' in Estonian, meaning 'percent'. It's used when referring to a percentage of something or indicating an amount less than 100 percent. In English, it translates directly to 'percent' and follows numbers in the same way as in English."
