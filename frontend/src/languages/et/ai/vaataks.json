  "context": "The word 'vaataks' is the conditional form (conditional mood) of the Estonian verb 'vaatama', which means 'to look', 'to watch', or 'to see'. In English, it corresponds to 'would look/watch/see'. This form is used to express hypothetical situations, wishes, or polite requests. For example, in the first sentence 'Vaataks mind kuiks!', it's expressing a wish for someone to look at them; in the second question 'Kas sa vaataksid seda filmi?', it's asking if someone would watch that movie (hypothetical situation); and in the third negative sentence 'Tema ei vaataks kunagi sellist asja.', it states that someone would never do such a thing. The '-ks' ending is characteristic of the conditional mood in Estonian."
