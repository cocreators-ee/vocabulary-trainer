  "context": "The word 'ajaloo' is the genitive case form of 'ajalugu', which means 'history'. In Estonian, the genitive case typically shows possession or association, so 'ajaloo' can mean 'of history', 'in history', or related to history. It's commonly used in phrases like 'ajaloo tund' (history class) or 'raamat ajaloost' (a book about history)."
