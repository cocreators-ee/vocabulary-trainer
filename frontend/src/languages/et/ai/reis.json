  "context": "In Estonian, 'reis' primarily means a trip or journey. It comes from Middle Low German 'reise'. The word can refer to any kind of travel - whether by car, train, plane, or other means. For example: 'Käisin reisil Prantsusmaal' (I went on a trip to France), 'Oleme teel pikkale reisile Eestisse' (We are going on a long journey to Estonia). Note that this word is different from the Estonian word for thigh, which is also spelled 'reis' but has different grammatical forms and etymology."
