  "context": "The Estonian word 'ajalugu' has multiple related meanings: 1) The process of development of society and nature (e.g., European history, Tallinn's history); 2) Distant past preserved in human consciousness (e.g., World War II battles have become history); 3) A science or subject dealing with the development of society (the study of history as a discipline); 4) In computing/banking, a list or record of performed actions/transactions. The word literally means 'time story' from components 'aja' (time) + 'lugu' (story), making it a calque of German Zeitgeschichte."
