  "context": "The Estonian word 'käiku' is in the partitive case and means 'into operation/use/circulation'. It's used when starting up machinery, putting things into use, or releasing something for circulation. For example: käigu laskma (to start/start up), käigu minema (to go/enter into operation). This form typically follows verbs like 'laskma' (to let/release) and 'panema' (to put/set)."
