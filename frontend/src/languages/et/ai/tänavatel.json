  "context": "The word 'tänavatel' is the Estonian adessive case plural form of 'tänav' (street). It indicates location or position, meaning 'on/among/in the streets'. The '-tel' ending in the adessive case typically translates to 'on' or 'at', and when used with plural nouns like tänavad (streets), it shows being located among or on multiple streets. This form is commonly used to describe where activities take place, such as people walking, playing, meeting, or other street-related activities happening in various locations around the city."
