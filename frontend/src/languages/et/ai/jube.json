  "context": "The Estonian word 'jube' is an intensifier adverb that means 'very', 'really', or 'extremely'. It's used to emphasize the degree of an adjective or verb, similar to how English speakers might use words like 'very', 'really', 'super', or 'terribly' for emphasis. The word can be found in various contexts - it can modify adjectives (as in 'jube ilus' meaning 'very beautiful'), verbs (as in 'jube palun' meaning 'please/pretty please'), and other parts of speech to add emphasis."
