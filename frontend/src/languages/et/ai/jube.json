  "context": "In Estonian, 'jube' is an adverb that expresses intensity or emphasis. It's colloquial and can be used to mean 'very,' 'really,' or 'extremely.' When used with adjectives, it intensifies them - making something described as good even better (jube head kotletid = very good cutlets) or bad worse (maru film = terrible movie). It's a versatile intensifier similar in function to 'really' or 'very' in English."
