  "context": "The Estonian verb 'andestada' means to forgive someone or something, implying that one stops feeling anger or resentment and ceases to blame or seek revenge. It can also mean to excuse or pardon a fault or offense. In the imperative form (andestage), it's used as a polite request for forgiveness in situations where one might actually need directions or assistance."
