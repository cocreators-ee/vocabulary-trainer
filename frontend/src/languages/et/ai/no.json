  "context": "\"No\" is a versatile Estonian modal adverb that serves multiple functions in conversation. It can express various emotions and attitudes depending on context - from emphasis and exclamation to concession, surprise, or urgency. It often appears at the beginning of sentences before certain words to highlight tone and convey specific relationships. Common uses include expressing annoyance (no, mis sa teed!), agreement (no olgu), surprise (no kas siis naerda ka enam ei tohi?), requests (no lähme), curses (no säh), or indicating a shift in thought (no aga raha). It's similar to English words like 'well', 'oh', 'really', 'come on' depending on the specific context and emotional nuance required."
