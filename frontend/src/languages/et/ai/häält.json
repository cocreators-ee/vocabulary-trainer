  "context": "The word 'häält' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'hääl', which means 'sound' or 'voice'. In this form, it typically appears after verbs that take a partitive object, such as 'kuulema' (to hear). The partitive case in Estonian often indicates an incomplete action or what is being heard. For example, 'Kas sa kuuled häält?' means 'Do you hear sound/voice?' where the focus is on the perception of the voice/sound rather than a complete action."
