  "context": "The word 'nendel' appears to be an Estonian word meaning 'these' (plural demonstrative pronoun). However, based on the dictionary definitions provided, it seems there might be some confusion in the data as the definitions are for a different word 'joru'. The word 'nendel' is actually the plural form of 'see' (this) and means 'those' or 'these' in English. It's used to point to specific people or things that are near the speaker or have been previously mentioned."
