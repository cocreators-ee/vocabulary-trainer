  "context": "The Estonian word 'nendel' is the adessive case plural form of the demonstrative pronoun 'need', which means 'those'. It functions as an inessive/adessive case marker indicating location or position at/in/on something. The '-l' ending indicates the adessive case, and it's used when referring to multiple things/people that are located at a particular place or when specifying the location where something occurs."
