  "context": "The word 'seadust' in Estonian is the partitive form of 'seadus' meaning 'law/rule'. In this context, it appears in the phraseüle astuma seadust' which means 'to step/violate over laws/rules'. The dictionary definition shows that 'üle astuda' means to step over or cross something from one side to another, and when used with 'seadust', it specifically refers to breaking rules, regulations, or laws. This is a common construction in Estonian where the action of crossing/breaking is applied to abstract concepts like rules."
