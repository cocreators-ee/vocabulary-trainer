  "context": "The Estonian word 'seadust' is the partitive form of 'seadus', meaning 'law' or 'statute'. The partitive case in Estonian indicates that something is being discussed, referred to, or measured. So 'seadust' would be used when talking about laws in general, referring to them as a group, or indicating some portion of laws. For example, 'Seadused on vajalikud korra tagamiseks' means 'Laws are necessary for maintaining order', where the partitive form indicates reference to the concept of laws in general."
