  "context": "The word 'inimest' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'inimene', which means 'person' or 'human being'. In this case, it's used to refer to a person or people in the context where we're talking about some of them (partitive case). The dictionary also shows an alternative definition related to anthroposophy as a religious-mystical doctrine that venerates humans as divine children, which is a more specialized usage."
