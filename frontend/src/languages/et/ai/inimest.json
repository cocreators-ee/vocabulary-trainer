  "context": "The word 'inimest' appears to be the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'inimene', which means 'person'. In Estonian, nouns have different cases depending on their grammatical function. The partitive case is often used to indicate an incomplete action or when referring to a quantity of something. 'Inimest' would translate to 'of a person' or '(some) person' in English."
