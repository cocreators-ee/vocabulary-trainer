  "context": "The Estonian word 'minu' is the possessive pronoun that means 'my' or 'mine'. It indicates possession and is used to show that something belongs to the speaker. The word changes form depending on what it modifies (e.g., minu raamat - my book, minu auto - my car). In questions like 'Kas see on sinu või minu auto?', it's used to distinguish between whose item is being discussed."
