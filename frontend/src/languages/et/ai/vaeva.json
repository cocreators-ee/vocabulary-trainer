  "context": "In Estonian, 'annakse' is the 3rd person singular present form of the verb 'andma', which primarily means 'to give'. However, in these specific contexts, it's used idiomatically to express that something requires effort or strength. When used impersonally with '-ks' suffix (as in 'annaks'), it indicates that an action is possible but requires effort - similar to English expressions like 'it takes two men to lift' or 'it gives one pause'. The word implies a degree of difficulty or the expenditure of physical/mental energy."
