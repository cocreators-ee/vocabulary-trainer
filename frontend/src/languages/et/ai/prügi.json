  "context": "The word 'prügi' in Estonian refers to waste material, garbage, trash, or junk that is unwanted and discarded. It can be used literally for physical refuse like household trash, but also figuratively for worthless things or even as slang for money (though this usage appears less common). The word can appear in various contexts - describing scattered debris, emphasizing worthlessness, or referring to waste materials. Examples include wind blowing garbage around, taking dirt from one's eye, and discarding unwanted items."
