  "context": "The Estonian word 'lausa' is an adverb that has two main meanings: 1) completely, entirely, absolutely - used to emphasize that something happens fully or without reservation (e.g., 'tuul paisus lausa tormiks' means the wind grew into a full storm), and 2) straightforwardly, directly - used when someone speaks frankly without beating around the bush (e.g., 'küsi lausa' means ask outright/directly). It's an intensifier that adds emphasis to verbs and adjectives."
