  "context": "The word 'lausa' appears to be an Estonian noun meaning 'sentence' or 'phrase'. It's likely in the nominative singular form. In Estonian, nouns can have different forms depending on case and number, so this could also potentially appear as 'lause' (standard spelling), 'lausas', 'lausasse', etc., when declined. The word refers to a grammatical unit of words expressing a complete thought."
