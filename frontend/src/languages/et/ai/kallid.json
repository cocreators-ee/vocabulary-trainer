  "context": "The word 'kallid' is the plural form of the Estonian adjective 'kalda', which means 'dear' or 'beloved'. It's used as a polite term of address, similar to how English speakers might use 'dears' when addressing multiple people with affection or respect. In the dictionary example provided, it appears at the beginning of a quote: '\"Kallid kolleegid!\" algas Jaan.' which translates to '\"Dear colleagues!\" said Jaan.' The word is typically used vocatively - directly addressing someone."
