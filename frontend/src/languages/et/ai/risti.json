It can be used as an adverb meaning crosswise or perpendicular (at a right angle), for example when describing movements that are at 90 degrees to something else. In card games, 'risti' refers to the suit of clubs. As an intensifier, it means completely or diametrically, often used in expressions like 'risti vastupidised' meaning diametrically opposite."
