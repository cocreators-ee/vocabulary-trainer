It can mean 'cross' (as in the symbol or wooden structure), 'intersection' (where roads meet), 'across' (a preposition indicating movement across something), or refer to a specific location like 'at the crossroads'. In rural Estonia, 'risti' often refers to a cross-shaped landmark or intersection of paths. The word is commonly used when giving directions or describing locations where paths or roads meet at right angles."
