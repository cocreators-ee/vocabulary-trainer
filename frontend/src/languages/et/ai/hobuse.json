  "context": "The word 'hobuse' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'hobune', which means 'horse'. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is used to indicate an incomplete action or indefinite quantity. So 'hobuse' would translate to '(a) horse' in English when referring to one horse in contexts like buying, seeing, or mentioning a horse without specifying it completely. This form appears after verbs that require the partitive case."
