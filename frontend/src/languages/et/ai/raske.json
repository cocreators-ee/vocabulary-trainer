  "context": "The Estonian word 'raske' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean physically heavy (like a heavy stone), difficult or hard to do (like difficult math problems), serious or severe (like serious illness), or refer to something that requires great effort or causes burden. The adjective changes form based on case and number in Estonian, with forms like 'raskem' (comparative) and 'kõige raskem' (superlative)."
