  "context": "The Estonian word 'valvel' is an adverb that describes being in a state of watchfulness, alertness, or attention. It can be used to describe physical guards on duty (like 'Vahid on valvel' - The guards are on guard), staying awake instead of sleeping ('Mul ei olnud und, lamasin pool ööd valvel' - I couldn't sleep, lay awake for half the night), or being mentally alert and attentive to one's surroundings. It carries connotations of vigilance, attentiveness, and readiness to respond."
