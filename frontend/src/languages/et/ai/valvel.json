  "context": "The Estonian word 'valvel' is an adverbial form meaning 'on watch' or 'awake'. It describes a state of being alert, vigilant, and watchful. This form comes from the root word 'valve' which means guard/watch. The '-el' ending transforms it into an adverb indicating the manner in which someone is keeping watch or staying awake. It's commonly used to describe someone who is supposed to be watching over something or staying alert during a period when others might be sleeping."
