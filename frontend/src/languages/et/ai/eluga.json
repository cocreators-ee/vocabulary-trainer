  "context": "In Estonian, 'eluga' is an adverbial form that means 'quickly' or 'rapidly'. It's derived from the noun 'elu' (life) and is used in colloquial speech to urge someone to do something quickly. The word appears in phrases like 'Tehke nüüd eluga!' which means 'Do it now, quickly!' This usage shows how Estonian uses a noun form as an adverb to express speed or urgency."
