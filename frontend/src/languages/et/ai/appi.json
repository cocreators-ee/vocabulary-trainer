  "context": "In Estonian, 'appi' is an adverb that means 'to help' or 'for assistance.' It's often used when someone needs help in a situation of difficulty or emergency. The word can indicate coming to someone's aid physically (like helping carry items) or in an urgent situation (like calling for help during a fire). It appears as the illative singular form of the noun 'abi' (help)."
