  "context": "The Estonian word 'kana' primarily means 'chicken' or specifically 'hen'. It refers to domestic birds kept for eggs and meat. The word can also be used metaphorically to refer to women, either insultingly (as a foolish/trivial woman) or affectionately (as a term of endearment). In compound words like 'kaljukana', it's used as the second part to name other bird species."
