  "context": "The Estonian word 'teadus' primarily means science - the systematic activity aimed at acquiring new true knowledge, systematizing it and applying it. It can also refer to knowledge or information in a more general sense. The word derives from 'teadma' (to know) plus the suffix '-us'. In its different forms, it appears as 'teaduse' (genitive), 'teadust' (partitive), and 'teadused' (plural)."
