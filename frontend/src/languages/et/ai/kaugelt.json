  "context": "Kaugelt is an Estonian adverb with multiple meanings. Primarily, it means 'from far away' or 'from afar', indicating distance in space (people came from near and far). It can also mean 'from a long time ago' when referring to time. Additionally, it's used intensively to mean 'considerably', 'much', or 'very much' when comparing things (something is considerably better/more expensive/larger). The word comes from the ablative singular form of kauge (far/distant)."
