  "context": "The Estonian word 'meeleheitel' is an adjective that describes someone who has lost all hope and is desperate. It comes from the root 'meel' (mind/soul) combined with 'heitel' which suggests a state of being without hope or having given up. This person would be willing to do anything in their final attempt, showing characteristics similar to what might be described as a desperado in English - someone who has nothing left to lose and will take extreme measures."
