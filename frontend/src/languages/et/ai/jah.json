  "context": "The Estonian word 'jah' is a versatile interjection that functions primarily as an affirmative response equivalent to English 'yes'. It can be used to express agreement, confirmation of statements, and strengthen affirmations. Additionally, it serves different purposes in various contexts: it can indicate an expected positive answer when used in questions ('Jah?' - 'Yes?'), express doubt or disbelief ('Võtab ta sul, jah, õppust!' - 'Does he teach you, yes, a lesson!'), and is sometimes used as an interjection expressing realization or acknowledgment ('Ah jah' - showing sudden understanding). The word's flexibility allows it to convey multiple nuances depending on tone and context."
