  "context": "Poja is the genitive singular form of 'poeg' which means son. It indicates possession or belonging - literally meaning 'of a son' or 'his/her son'. In examples, it can also be used as an affectionate term to address a young boy, similar to how we might say 'son', 'lad', or 'young man' in English when addressing someone directly."
