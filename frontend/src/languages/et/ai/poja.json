  "context": "The word 'poja' is the partitive case form of 'poeg', which means 'son' in Estonian. The partitive case is used when expressing partiality, indefiniteness, or when something is being acted upon. In these sentences, it indicates that we are talking about a son but not necessarily specifying which one or emphasizing the action performed on him."
