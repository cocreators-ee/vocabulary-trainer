  "context": "The word 'vastuseid' is the partitive plural form of 'vastus', which means answer or reply in Estonian. The '-d' ending indicates that it's a plural noun, and the '-i-' vowel before the case marker shows it follows the weak-grade declension pattern. This form is used when referring to answers in an indefinite quantity or when they are objects of the sentence."
