  "context": "The Estonian word 'tuul' means wind - the movement of air in nature. It's a common noun that can describe different types of winds (strong, weak, gentle, etc.) and is used both literally for actual wind and metaphorically for changes or circumstances. The word follows regular Estonian declension patterns with forms like tuule (genitive), tuult (partitive), and tuulesse (illative)."
