  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuhu' is an interrogative adverb that means 'where' or 'to where'. It's used to ask about a location or destination. In Estonian grammar, it's formed by adding the allative case ending '-u' to the root 'koh-' (place/location). This makes it specifically indicate direction toward a place rather than just location like 'kus' (where)."
