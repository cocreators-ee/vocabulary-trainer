  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuhu' is an interrogative and relative adverb meaning 'where' or 'to where'. It's used to ask about destination or direction of movement. As shown in the dictionary definitions, it functions as a question word asking 'to what place/destination' and can also introduce relative clauses indicating destination. In some expressions, it can refer to an unspecified place toward which movement is directed."
