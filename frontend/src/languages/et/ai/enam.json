  "context": "The Estonian word 'enam' is an adverb that means 'no longer', 'not anymore', or 'any more'. It's used to indicate that a situation has changed and something that was previously true is no longer the case. In its positive form, it can also mean 'more' (comparative), but in the negative constructions shown in the examples, it functions as an adverb expressing cessation of a state or action."
