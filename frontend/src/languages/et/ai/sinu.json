  "context": "'Sinu' is the possessive pronoun in Estonian that means 'your' in an informal, singular context. It is used to show possession or relationship from one person to another when addressing someone you know well or are on familiar terms with. This word is the genitive and accusative form of 'sina', which means 'you'. In English, it would correspond to 'your' when speaking to a single friend or family member."
