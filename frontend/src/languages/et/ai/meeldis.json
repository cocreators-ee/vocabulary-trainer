  "context": "The word 'meeldis' is the third-person singular past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'meeldima', which means 'to like' or 'to be pleased with'. It corresponds to English verbs such as 'liked', 'pleased', or 'enjoyed' in the simple past tense. For example, if someone says 'Talle meeldis see raamat', it means 'He/she liked this book'. The word indicates that an action of liking happened in the past by a single subject (he/she/it)."
