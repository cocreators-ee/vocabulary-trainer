  "context": "The word 'huvita' is the abessive singular form of 'huvi', meaning 'without interest'. However, based on context and usage patterns, it appears to function as a verb form meaning 'to be interested in' or 'to take an interest in something'. It's commonly used with negative constructions (ei huvita) to express lack of interest. The positive construction would indicate being interested or curious about something."
