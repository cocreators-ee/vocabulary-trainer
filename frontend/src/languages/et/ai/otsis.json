  "context": "The word 'otsis' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'otsima', which means 'to search' or 'to look for'. It indicates that someone was actively searching or looking for something in the past. The dictionary definition provided shows it used in a context where someone is seeking a new sense/sensibility (aist), suggesting it can be used both literally when searching for physical objects and metaphorically when searching for abstract concepts."
