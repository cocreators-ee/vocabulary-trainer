  "context": "The Estonian word 'valitseja' refers to someone who has authority and control over people or a territory. It can mean a hereditary head of state, a ruler with power in a specific region, an organizer or commander in charge of something, or an administrator. The word comes from the root verb 'valitsema' (to rule) plus the suffix '-ja' (agent noun), literally meaning 'one who rules'. It can refer to both male and female rulers (compare with 'naisvalitseja' - female ruler)."
