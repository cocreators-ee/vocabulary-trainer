  "context": "The Estonian word 'seltsimees' is a compound noun consisting of 'seltsi-' (meaning 'society' or 'company') and '-mees' (meaning 'man'). It translates to English as 'comrade,' 'fellow,' 'buddy,' or 'mate.' The term was historically used in communist contexts to refer to fellow party members, but it's now more commonly used as a general term of address for any male person, similar to how one might say 'buddy' or 'mate' in English. It can be used both formally and informally depending on the context."
