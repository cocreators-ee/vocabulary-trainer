  "context": "'Temast' is the elative case form of the Estonian pronoun 'tema' (he/him). The elative case indicates movement from or origin, so 'temast' means 'from him' or can be used more generally to indicate something coming from, about, or concerning someone. It's used when talking about where information comes from, who something originates from, or when discussing characteristics of a male person."
