  "context": "The word 'patronaat' in Estonian refers to the concept of patronage or protection provided by a powerful person or entity. It can mean the care and guardianship given to someone, often involving a formal relationship where one party provides support or resources to another in exchange for loyalty or service. The term is commonly used in historical contexts referring to the rights of influential individuals over others, but also more broadly to describe modern relationships of sponsorship or protective care."
