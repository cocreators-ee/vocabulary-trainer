  "context": "The word 'temast' in Estonian is the 3rd person singular partitive case form of the pronoun used to mean about him/her/it. It's typically found after prepositions meaning 'about,' such as 'võta' (take) or verbs that require indirect objects with a preposition indicating direction. The form depends on gender and number, but in neutral contexts it can be translated more broadly."
