  "context": "The word 'mõneks' is the illative case form of 'mõni' (some) in Estonian, meaning 'into some' or 'for some'. It is often used to indicate temporary duration or limited time periods. This form typically follows a noun expressing time (like 'ajaks' - for a time/period) and indicates that something happened or was intended to happen for a certain period of time. It can also be used more broadly to express temporary nature or transience."
