  "context": "Midagi is the partitive form of the Estonian pronoun 'miski', meaning 'something'. It's used to refer to an unspecified or unknown thing, person, or concept. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case often indicates partialness or indefiniteness, which fits perfectly with the meaning of 'something' - it suggests we're talking about some undetermined entity rather than a specific one."
