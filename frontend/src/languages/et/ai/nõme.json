  "context": "The Estonian word 'nõme' is an adjective meaning stupid, dull, or foolish. It was coined ex nihilo by Johannes Aavik in 1932. The word describes someone who lacks knowledge, understanding, or common sense. It can be used to describe people (a stupid person), things (stupid comments/behavior), or abstract concepts. The comparative form is 'nõmedam' and the superlative is 'kõige nõmedam'. Examples include calling a person nõme inimene (stupid person) or describing something as being done out of stupidity ('nõmedast jonnist')."
