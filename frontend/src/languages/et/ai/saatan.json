  "context": "The Estonian word 'saatan' has multiple meanings: 1) As a noun, it refers to the devil or Satan - an evil spirit that tempts people away from God; 2) As an interjection and curse word (somewhat milder than 'kurat'), used to express negative emotions (and sometimes positive ones). It can be used in various forms as both a standalone exclamation ('Ai saatan, kui valus!' - Oh devil, how painful!) and when addressing someone negatively ('Sina saatan, tee, et kaod siit!' - You devil, make these losses disappear!). The word appears in different contexts from religious references to common everyday cursing."
