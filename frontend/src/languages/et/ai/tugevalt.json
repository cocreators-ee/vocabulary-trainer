  "context": "Tugevalt is an Estonian adverb that means 'strongly', 'forcefully', 'firmly', or 'heavily'. It is used to describe actions performed with great intensity, force, or strength. The word comes from the adjective 'tugev' (strong) and the adverbial suffix '-lt'. In comparative form it becomes 'tugevamalt' (more strongly). Examples include pressing someone's hand firmly, a pulse beating strongly, or turning screws tightly."
