  "context": "In Estonian, 'miili' is related to English 'mail' but in the context of sports terminology, it specifically refers to a mile (the distance). It's commonly used in athletics for runners who specialize in middle-distance races, particularly the one-mile race. The word appears in compound forms like 'veerandmailer' (quarter-miler) which refers to someone who runs quarter-mile distances."
