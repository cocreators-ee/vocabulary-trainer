  "context": "The word 'käitu' appears to be a typo or variation of the Estonian word 'narr', which means fool, idiot, clown, or jester. The dictionary definition shows that 'narr' refers to someone who behaves inappropriately or foolishly according to others' opinions - someone who shouldn't be taken seriously and is somewhat arrogant. It can also mean a clown/jester in court or theater contexts, and as an adjective it means silly, ridiculous, or embarrassing."
