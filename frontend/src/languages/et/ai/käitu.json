  "context": "The word 'käitu' appears to be a form of the Estonian verb 'käima', which means 'to go' or 'to walk'. In these examples, it seems to be used in greetings and introductions. The exact meaning depends on the context - in 'Kuidas sa käidu?', it's asking about someone's condition (how are you?), while in other contexts it could mean welcome or be part of introducing oneself."
