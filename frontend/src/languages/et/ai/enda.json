  "context": "The Estonian word 'enda' is a reflexive pronoun that means 'self', 'own', or '-self'. It has no nominative form and serves to indicate that the action of the verb refers back to the subject. It can function as an object, adverbial, or possessive attribute, emphasizing ownership or self-reference. The word declines regularly but with irregular forms in different cases."
