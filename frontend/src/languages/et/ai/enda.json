  "context": "The Estonian word 'enda' is a reflexive pronoun and possessive adjective that means 'one's own' or 'oneself.' It is used to indicate that the subject of the sentence is also the object, referring back to the subject. When used as a possessive adjective, it shows possession by the subject themselves (e.g., 'end auto' = 'one's own car'). As a reflexive pronoun, it indicates that the action is performed by the subject on themselves (e.g., 'enda tööd teha' = 'to do work for oneself')."
