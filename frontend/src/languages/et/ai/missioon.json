  "context": "In Estonian, 'missioon' is a loanword from English/German that has two main meanings: 1) A life purpose or calling - an important responsibility or destiny in life, and 2) A military or diplomatic mission - a special assignment abroad. The word can be used in various contexts including personal fulfillment (writer's mission), religious duty (priest's mission to save souls), or official government tasks (military missions). It carries connotations of importance, purposefulness, and often implies a sense of higher calling or responsibility."
