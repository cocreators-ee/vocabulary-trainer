  "context": "The Estonian word 'keskele' is an adverbial form that indicates movement toward or into the middle/center of something. It's formed from the root 'kesk-' (meaning middle/center) with the '-ele' suffix indicating direction or goal. This word shows motion toward a central point, similar to English expressions like 'into the middle' or 'to the center'."
