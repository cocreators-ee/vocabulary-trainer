  "context": "The Estonian word 'terves' is the inessive singular form of 'terve', which means 'sound' or 'healthy'. As 'terves', it functions as an adverbial expression meaning 'of sound mind' or 'sane'. It's used to describe someone who has rational thinking and good judgment, often questioning whether someone is acting reasonably. For example, when someone behaves strangely in a way that makes others question their mental state, Estonians might use this phrase."
