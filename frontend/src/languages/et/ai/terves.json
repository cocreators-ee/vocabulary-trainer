  "context": "The word 'terves' in Estonian is the imperative form of the verb 'tere' (to say hello/greet). It's commonly used as a greeting when meeting someone. The most common usage is in the phrase 'Tervist!' which means 'Hello!' orGreetings!'. While literally meaning 'be healthy/well', it has evolved to be the standard greeting in Estonian, similar to 'hello' in English. When asking about someone's wellbeing, one might say 'Kuidas terved?' (How are you/are you well?)."
