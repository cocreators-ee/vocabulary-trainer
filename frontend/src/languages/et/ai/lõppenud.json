  "context": "The word 'lõppenud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'lõppema', which means 'to end' or 'to finish'. It describes something that has already reached its conclusion, whether it's a project, event, period of time, or activity. In Estonian grammar, this form agrees with the subject in gender and number when used predicatively, though as a past participle it can also function adjectivally to describe completed states."
