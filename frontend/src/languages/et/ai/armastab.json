  "context": "The word 'armastab' is the third-person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'armastama'. It means that someone loves, likes, or has a strong affection for something. This is used when talking about what he/she/it loves in the present tense. For example: 'Tüdruk armastab koeri' means 'The girl loves dogs', where 'tüdruk' (girl) is doing the loving and 'koeri' (dogs) is what is being loved."
