  "context": "The word 'kõvemini' is the comparative form of 'kõva' (hard/strong). It means 'more forcefully', 'more strongly', or 'harder'. It's used to indicate a greater degree of force, intensity, or difficulty in performing an action. In Estonian, adjectives typically have comparative forms created with specific suffixes, and this word follows that pattern by adding '-mini' to the base form."
