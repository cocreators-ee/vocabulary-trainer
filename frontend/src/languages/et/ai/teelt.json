  "context": "The Estonian word 'teelt' is the elative case form of 'tee', which means 'road', 'path', or 'street'. The elative case in Estonian indicates movement away from something, so 'teelt' literally means 'from (the) road/path/street'. It's used to indicate that someone or something has moved off a road or path. For example, 'ta on teelt 채ra k천ndinud' means 'he/she has walked off the road', and 'me peame leidma teelt maha' means 'we need to find it off the road'."
