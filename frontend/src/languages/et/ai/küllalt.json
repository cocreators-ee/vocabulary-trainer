  "context": "Küllalt is an Estonian adverb with three main uses: 1) as 'sufficiently' or 'enough' when indicating adequacy (e.g., having enough of something), 2) as 'quite' or 'rather' for moderate degree, and 3) expressing that someone has had too much of something. The word can modify both positive qualities ('kallis' - expensive) and negative situations where someone wants something to stop."
