  "context": "The Estonian word 'kyllalt' is an adverb that means 'enough' or 'sufficiently'. It's used to indicate that there is a sufficient quantity, amount, or degree of something. The word comes from 'küll', which expresses affirmation or certainty, combined with '-alt', indicating manner or extent. When using 'kyllalt', it typically follows the verb in a sentence and modifies the action by showing adequacy."
