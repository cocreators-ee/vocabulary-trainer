  "context": "The Estonian word 'põhjal' is an adverbial form of the adjective 'põhjalik', meaning thorough or detailed. It describes doing something with great care, attention to detail, and completeness. The '-l' ending indicates this is an inessive case form (meaning 'in' or 'with'), so 'põhjal' literally means 'in a thorough way' or 'with thoroughness'. It modifies verbs to indicate that the action is being done meticulously and completely."
