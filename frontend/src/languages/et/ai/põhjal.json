  "context": "The Estonian word 'põhjal' is used as a postposition (similar to an adverb) meaning 'based on', 'according to', or 'on the basis of'. It indicates that something is being done, said, or determined based on certain grounds, facts, evidence, or observations. This form appears to be in the illative case, showing the foundation for an action or decision."
