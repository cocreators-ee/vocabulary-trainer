  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõri' has multiple meanings. Primarily, it refers to the throat or larynx in anatomy - the beginning of the respiratory tract and organ of voice production. It can also mean the neck area (front part), as in expressions about cutting through the throat. Additionally, it's used colloquially to refer to someone who drinks alcohol heavily ('kõva kõri' meaning a heavy drinker). The word appears in compound words like 'hingekõri' (windpipe) and 'söögikõri' (gullet/esophagus)."
