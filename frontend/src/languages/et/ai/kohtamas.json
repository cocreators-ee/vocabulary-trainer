  "context": "The word 'kohtamas' is the partitive case form of the verb 'kohtama', which means 'to meet'. In Estonian, verbs are conjugated and also change their endings based on grammatical cases. The partitive case '-mas' ending indicates that this is an ongoing or incomplete action - in other words, meeting someone or being in the process of meeting. This form is typically used when you're actively engaged in the act of meeting someone or arranging to meet them."
