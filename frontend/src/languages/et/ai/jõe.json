  "context": "The word 'jõe' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'jõgi', which means 'river'. In Estonian, genitive case indicates possession or relationship, so 'jõe' literally means 'of the river' or 'belonging to the river'. This grammatical form is used when showing what something belongs to or originates from in relation to a river. For example, if saying 'the tree by the river', you would use 'jõe puu' (tree of the river)."
