  "context": "The Estonian word 'jõe' is the genitive singular form of the noun 'jõgi', which means 'river'. In English, we would translate this as 'of a river' or 'belonging to a river'. It's used in contexts where something belongs to or is associated with a river. For example: 'jõe kaldal' means 'on the bank of a river', and 'jõe ääres' means 'by the river'."
