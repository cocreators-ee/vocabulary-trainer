  "context": "The Estonian word 'uskuge' is the second person plural imperative form of the verb 'usuma' (to believe). It literally translates to 'believe!' when addressing multiple people. The word comes from the same root as English 'faith' and German 'Glaube', sharing common Indo-European origins related to trust, conviction, and confidence in something or someone."
