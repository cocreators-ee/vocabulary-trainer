  "context": "The word 'kulul' is an Estonian adjective that means expensive or costly. It describes something that has a high price or requires significant financial expenditure. This form appears to be in the elative case (from state), suggesting it might mean 'from being expensive' or used in contexts where expense is being considered as a point of departure for comparison or measurement."
