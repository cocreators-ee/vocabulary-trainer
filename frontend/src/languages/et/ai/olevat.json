  "context": "The Estonian word 'olevat' is the quotative/connegative form of the verb 'olema' (to be). It's used when reporting what someone said or thought about being in a certain state, often with verbs like 'nägema' (to see) or 'tahtma' (to want). This form creates distance from the statement and indicates reported speech or hypothetical situations."
