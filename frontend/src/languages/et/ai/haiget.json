  "context": "The word 'haiget' is the partitive case form of the Estonian adjective 'haige', meaning sore or painful. It's used to describe body parts or areas that are experiencing pain or discomfort. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case often indicates partiality or indefinite nature, so 'haiget' would be used when referring to a sore area rather than something specifically identified as sore."
