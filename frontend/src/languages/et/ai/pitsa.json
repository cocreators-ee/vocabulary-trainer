  "context": "The Estonian word 'pitsa' is borrowed directly from Italian and means pizza. It's a loanword that has been adopted into the Estonian language with minimal changes in spelling or pronunciation. The word follows standard Estonian noun declension patterns, changing forms in different grammatical cases (genitive pitsa, partitive pitsat). In Estonian, it refers specifically to the Italian dish - an open-faced, heavily spiced pie with various fillings."
