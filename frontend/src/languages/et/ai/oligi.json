  "context": "The Estonian word 'oligi' is an adverbial construction formed from the verb 'olema' (to be) in past tense combined with a particle. It's used to express something that actually turned out to be true or happened, often with a slight sense of surprise or emphasis on the realization. The word functions as an intensifier that highlights that something is indeed the case after perhaps being uncertain before."
