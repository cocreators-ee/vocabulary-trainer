  "context": "The Estonian word 'esimesena' is an adverb that means 'first' or 'in the first position'. It's formed from 'esimene' (first) with the '-na' suffix indicating an adverbial form, similar to how English uses '-ly' for many adverbs. This word indicates being in the first position or doing something before others."
