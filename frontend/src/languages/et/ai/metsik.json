  "context": "The Estonian word 'metsik' describes something that is wild, untamed, or fierce. It can be used to describe plants growing in nature without cultivation (wild), animals not domesticated (untamed), or people/animals with a fierce or savage character. The word derives from the Estonian word 'mets' meaning forest, suggesting something naturally found in forests rather than controlled by humans."
