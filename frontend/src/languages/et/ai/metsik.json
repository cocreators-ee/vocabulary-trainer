  "context": "The Estonian word 'metsik' has multiple related meanings. It can describe nature that is untouched by human influence (wild, natural), animals or plants that are domesticated or cultivated (wild species), people who are uncivilised or barbaric, behavior that is uncontrollable or savage (crazy, wild), and also refers to something immense or extreme in intensity. The word derives from 'mets' meaning forest, suggesting a connection to untamed natural environments."
