  "context": "The Estonian word 'näevad' is the 3rd person plural present form of the verb 'nägema', which means 'to see' or 'to look'. In this case, it's used in the present tense to indicate that multiple people currently see something. The conjugation shows: näe- (stem) + -va- (present tense ending for 3rd person plural). This is commonly used when describing what a group of people can see or are looking at."
