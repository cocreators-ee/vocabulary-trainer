  "context": "The Estonian word 'ajanud' is the past participle form of the verb 'ajama', which means 'to drive' in English, specifically referring to operating a vehicle or machinery. It can also be used metaphorically to mean causing something to happen. The word indicates action that has been completed in the past and often follows auxiliary verbs like 'olema' (to be) in compound tenses."
