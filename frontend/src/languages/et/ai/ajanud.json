  "context": "The word 'ajanud' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'aiajama', which means to stretch, straighten, or reach out. It's used when describing someone extending their body parts or limbs in a particular direction. The word appears to be misspelled as 'ajanud' instead of 'õiendab' (the correct base form) in the dictionary examples, but based on context, it refers to the physical action of stretching or reaching."
