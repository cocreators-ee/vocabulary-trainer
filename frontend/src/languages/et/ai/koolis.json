  "context": "The word 'koolis' is the inessive case form of 'kool', which means 'school'. In Estonian, the inessive case (-s ending) indicates location within a place. So 'koolis' specifically means 'at school' or 'in school', indicating that someone is inside the school building or on school premises."
