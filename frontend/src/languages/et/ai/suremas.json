  "context": "The word 'suremas' is the elative case (from-locative) form of the verb 'surema', which means to die or perish. In Estonian, this form indicates motion from a state or position - so it literally means 'from dying' or 'out of dying'. It's used when someone is in the process of dying, indicating they are coming from a living state into death. This case form shows movement away from the state of being alive."
