  "context": "The Estonian word 'ega' is a conjunction that appears in negative sentences to connect either repeated elements (like multiple nouns or verbs) in negation, or to link separate clauses where at least one is negative. It can function as 'and not', 'also not', or 'nor'. In some contexts it starts questions with an expectation of a negative answer, or expresses agreement/refutation when used at the beginning of statements."
