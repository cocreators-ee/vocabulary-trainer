  "context": "The Estonian word 'ega' is a conjunction used to connect negative statements and means either/neither/nor. It's commonly used with negation words like 'ei' (not) to form compound sentences where both parts are negative. For example, 'Ega ma ei tea' means 'I don't know either'. The word helps express that something doesn't happen or isn't true in multiple contexts."
