  "context": "'Saitte' is the second-person plural past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'saama', meaning 'to get, receive, obtain'. It refers to what the listeners/audience have gotten or received in the past. The word appears with an interjection 'eheh' which seems to be a casual expression similar to 'hey' or 'well' before telling them about something they've accomplished."
