  "context": "The Estonian verb 'peksa' means to beat, spank, or hit. It appears to be used in compound forms only (as indicated by the dictionary note '(ainult ühendites)' meaning 'only in compounds'). The word is typically transitive and refers to physically hitting someone, often with some force or punishment connotation. In example sentences it's conjugated: peksa (infinitive), peksame (1st person plural present), peksid (2nd person singular present)."
