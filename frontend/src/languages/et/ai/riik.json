  "context": "The Estonian word 'riik' primarily refers to a political organization of human society with sovereign power over a specific territory - essentially meaning 'state', 'country', or 'polity'. It can also refer metaphorically to different realms, worlds, or spheres (like underwater kingdom) and in biological classification as the highest unit of living organisms (kingdom). The word comes from Low German/Swedish roots and has a rich system of declension forms including genitive 'riigi', partitive 'riiki', and plural 'riigid'."
