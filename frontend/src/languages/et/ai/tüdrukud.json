  "context": "The word 'tüdrukud' is the plural form of 'tüdruk' in Estonian. It means 'girls' and refers to multiple female individuals, typically young females or children. In Estonian, nouns have grammatical number, so '-d' at the end indicates this is the plural form rather than singular ('tüdruk'). This word would be used when referring to groups of girls in various contexts such as social gatherings, playgrounds, or describing groups of female friends or students."
