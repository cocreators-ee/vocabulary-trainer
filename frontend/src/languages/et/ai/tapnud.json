In Estonian, it agrees with the subject and indicates that someone has killed a person or people. This word specifically refers to killing humans (as opposed to animals), as indicated by the dictionary definition mentioning 'inimveri' (human blood) and examples showing 'tapnud inimese v. inimesi' (has killed a person/people)."
