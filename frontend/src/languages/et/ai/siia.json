  "context": "The Estonian word 'siia' is a deictic adverb that indicates movement towards the speaker's location or a place closer to the speaker. It functions similarly to English 'here' when referring to destination rather than current location. The word specifically shows direction toward where the speaker is, as opposed to 'sinna' (there) which indicates movement away from the speaker. 'Siia' can also be used more broadly to refer to a previously mentioned situation or context."
