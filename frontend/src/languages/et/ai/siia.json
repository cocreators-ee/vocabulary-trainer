  "context": "The Estonian word 'siia' is an adverb that means 'here' or 'to here'. It indicates direction toward the speaker's location. In Estonian grammar, it's part of a system showing motion toward vs away from the speaker (cf. 'sinna' - there/to there). It can be used independently as in commands ('Tule siia!' - Come here!) or as part of phrases indicating destination."
