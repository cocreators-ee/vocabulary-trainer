  "context": "The Estonian word 'esiteks' is an adverb that means 'firstly', 'in the first place', or 'to begin with'. It's used to introduce the first point in a list or sequence of arguments. The word breaks down as 'esi-' (meaning first/initial) + '-teks' (an instrumental case ending indicating purpose or manner), literally meaning 'as the first one' or 'for the first place'. This is commonly used in both spoken and written Estonian when someone wants to emphasize that they are starting with their primary point."
