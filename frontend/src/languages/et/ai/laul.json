  "context": "The Estonian word 'laul' has multiple related meanings. It primarily means 'song' - something that is sung or musical composition. It also refers to the act of singing itself, as well as musical expression through the human voice. In a broader sense, it can refer to natural sounds or mechanical noises described in poetic terms (like 'wind song' or 'engine song'). The word has rich cultural significance in Estonia, particularly associated with their famous choir traditions and Song Festival tradition."
