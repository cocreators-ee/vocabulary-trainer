  "context": "The Estonian word 'tapame' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the verb 'tappama', which means to kill, murder or slaughter. It's formed from the root word 'tap-' with the '-ma' infinitive ending and personal conjugation for 'we'. In this case, it specifically refers to the action performed by a group (we) in the present time."
