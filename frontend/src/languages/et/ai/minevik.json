  "context": "The Estonian word 'minevik' means 'past' or 'history'. It refers to the time that has already occurred and gone by, as opposed to the present or future. In Estonian grammar, it's a masculine noun in nominative case. When used in different cases, it would change form (e.g., genitive: 'mineviku', partitive: 'minevikku')."
