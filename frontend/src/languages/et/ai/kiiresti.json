  "context": "Kiiresti is an Estonian adverb that means 'quickly' or 'fast'. It is formed by adding the '-sti' suffix to the adjective 'kiire' (fast). The word describes actions performed at high speed or in a short amount of time. In examples, it's used to describe rapid movement ('liikuma'), rushing somewhere ('tormad'), and doing something hastily ('asjad kokku'). It can sometimes be intensified with repetition as shown in 'kiiresti-kiiresti'."
