  "context": "The word 'või' in Estonian has multiple meanings. As a conjunction, it means 'or' and is used to connect alternatives or choices. For example, 'Kas need on küüned või kunstküüned?' translates to 'Are those real nails or acrylics?' In colloquial speech, when placed at the end of a sentence as an interrogative particle, it serves to form yes/no questions. For instance, 'Kas ma pean tulema või?' means 'Do I have to come?' Additionally, 'või' can also mean 'butter,' which is a noun with specific declension patterns in Estonian. The word's pronunciation is approximately /vˈɤi̯/."
