  "context": "Tasuta is an Estonian adverb meaning 'free' or 'without charge'. It indicates that something does not require payment. The word comes from the abessive case of 'tasu' (payment/fee), literally meaning 'without fee'. In usage, it often appears before nouns like it would be used as an adjective in English, such as 'tasuta arstiabi' (free medical aid)."
