  "context": "The Estonian word 'kasi' is a verb form, specifically the imperative second person singular form of the verb 'kerima'. In this form it means 'wind!' or 'roll!' when used as an order. It can also mean 'go away!' or 'hurry away!' in colloquial usage. The basic meaning relates to winding/coiling something or curling up, but in imperative forms it becomes a command for action."
