  "context": "The Estonian word 'õhk' means 'air' or 'atmosphere'. It refers to the mixture of gases that we breathe, particularly oxygen and nitrogen. In Estonian, it can be used in both literal contexts (breathing air) as well as figurative contexts to refer to the general atmosphere or environment."
