  "context": "The Estonian word 'õhk' is a noun that primarily means 'air' - the gases making up the atmosphere. It can refer to physical air we breathe, but also metaphorically to the environment or atmosphere in which something exists. The word has various case forms including genitive õhu, partitive õhku, and plural nominative õhud. It's used both literally (referring to the atmospheric gases) and figuratively (describing an environment or atmosphere of some quality)."
