  "context": "The Estonian word 'nautige' is an imperative form of the verb that means to mortify the flesh, to torment oneself, or to practice self-denial for religious or spiritual purposes. It comes from the concept of 'liha suretama' (mortifying the flesh) and refers to deliberately causing physical discomfort or abstaining from worldly pleasures as part of ascetic practices often associated with monks seeking spiritual purification."
