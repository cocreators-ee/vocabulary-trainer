  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'endiselt' means 'still' or 'yet' in English. It indicates that something remains in the same state as before, unchanged or continuing. For example, if the sky was clear yesterday and is still clear today, you could say 'Taevas on endiselt selge' (The sky is still clear). This adverb expresses continuation of a state or action over time."
