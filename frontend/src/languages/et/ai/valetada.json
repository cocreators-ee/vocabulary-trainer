  "context": "The Estonian word 'valetada' is an infinitive form of the verb that means to lie or tell an untruth. It derives from the noun 'vale' which means falsehood, and the suffix '-da' creates the infinitive verb form. The word appears in dictionary definitions as a negative example where it's stated that 'pole ilus valetada' (it's not nice/good to lie), indicating this is a standard verb with clear moral implications against dishonesty."
