  "context": "The verb 'valetada' is the infinitive form in Estonian and means 'to lie' or 'to tell lies'. It's a regular first conjugation verb. The word comes from the root 'vale' which means 'false' or 'untrue', so literally it means to speak falsely. In different forms, it can be used in present tense (valetan - I lie), past tense (valetasin - I lied), and other grammatical constructions."
