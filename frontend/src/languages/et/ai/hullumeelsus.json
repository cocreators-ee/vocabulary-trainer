  "context": "Hullumeelsus is an Estonian noun meaning madness, insanity, or extreme irrational behavior. It derives from 'hull' (crazy) and '-meel-' (mind), referring to a state of mind that is not rational or sane. The word can describe both clinical mental illness states and situations of extreme foolishness or rash decision-making. In Estonian, it's typically used in formal contexts when discussing psychological conditions or metaphorical situations where someone behaves very irrationally."
