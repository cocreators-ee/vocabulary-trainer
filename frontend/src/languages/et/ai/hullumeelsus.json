  "context": "Hullumeelsus is an Estonian noun that refers to a state of losing one's reason or mind, acting without proper thought or judgment. It can describe both serious mental conditions (like madness approaching insanity) as well as more general foolishness or absurd behavior. The word combines 'hullu' (crazy/mad) with 'meelsus' (mind/state of mind), literally meaning 'craziness of the mind'. It's used to criticize actions that are unreasonable, illogical, or lack proper consideration."
