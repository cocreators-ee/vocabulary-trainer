  "context": "The Estonian word 'millele' is an interrogative pronoun in the allative case. It's formed by adding the allative ending '-le' to the stem 'mill-', which means 'what'. The word asks about direction, target, or purpose - essentially asking 'to what' or 'for what purpose'. It's used when you want to know the destination, recipient, or objective of something."
