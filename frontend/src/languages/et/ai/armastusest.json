  "context": "The word 'armastusest' is the elative case form of the Estonian noun 'armastus', meaning 'love'. The elative case indicates movement from or separation, so this form means 'out of love', 'from love', or 'about love'. It's used when something originates from love or is expressed in relation to love. For example, if someone sings songs about love, they sing 'laule armastusest' (songs of/about love)."
