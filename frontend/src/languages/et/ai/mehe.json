  "context": "The word 'mehe' is the genitive singular form of 'mees', meaning 'man'. In this context, it's used as part of the expression 'hea mehe poolest' which means 'of a good man' or 'because of the goodness of a person'. The genitive case indicates possession or origin in Estonian. It appears to be used here to indicate that something is done out of someone's kindness, goodwill, or helpful nature."
