  "context": "Enamasti is an Estonian adverb that means 'mostly', 'usually', or 'generally'. It indicates something that happens frequently or in most cases, but not always. For example, 'enamasti kuuseriisikad' means 'mostly chanterelles', implying they are the primary type of mushrooms found, though other types might also appear occasionally."
