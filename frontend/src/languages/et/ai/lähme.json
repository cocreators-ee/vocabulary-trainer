  "context": "The word 'lähme' is the partitive form of 'kiik', which refers to a swing or swing set. In Estonian, when referring to going to a swing, one uses the partitive case (lähme) instead of the nominative case (kiik). This is a common grammatical pattern in Estonian where the partitive case indicates movement toward or involvement with an object rather than just naming it."
