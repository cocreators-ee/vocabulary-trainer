  "context": "The word 'hoidku' is an Estonian interjection that expresses surprise, astonishment or amazement. It's often used with 'küll' to form the phrase 'hoidku küll', which would be similar in meaning to English expressions like 'Oh my goodness!', 'Goodness gracious!', or 'Wow!'. This expression conveys a sense of being overwhelmed by something unexpected or remarkable. The word appears to be in an imperative form but functions primarily as an emotional interjection rather than a command."
