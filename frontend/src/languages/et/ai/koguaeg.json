  "context": "The Estonian word 'koguaeg' is an adverb that means 'always', 'constantly', or 'continually'. It's formed from 'kogu' meaning 'whole' or 'entire' and 'aeg' meaning 'time', so literally it translates to 'all time' or 'whole time'. This word is used to indicate that something happens continuously, without interruption. For example, 'Koguaeg ta ootis sind' means 'He was always waiting for you.' The word doesn't change form in different grammatical contexts as it's an adverb."
