  "context": "The Estonian word 'salaja' is an adverb meaning secretly or privately. It comes from the root 'sala' (secret) with the suffix '-ja', and describes actions done in a way that others cannot see or know about - without being public, hidden from view. This word can be used to describe various secretive activities like entering/leaving places unnoticed, doing things behind someone's back, keeping information hidden, or operating covertly."
