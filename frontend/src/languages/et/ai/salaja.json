  "context": "The Estonian word 'salaja' is an adverb that means secretly or covertly. It describes actions done in a concealed manner, without others knowing about them. The word comes from the root 'salane' which relates to secrecy and hiddenness. It modifies verbs to indicate that the action was performed privately, often implying there was a reason to keep it hidden."
