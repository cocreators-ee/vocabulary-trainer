  "context": "The word 'suudate' is the plural form of the verb 'suda' which means 'to kiss'. In this case, it appears to be in a different grammatical context. Looking at the conjugation pattern, 'suudate' would actually be the second person plural ('you [plural] kiss') form of the verb 'suda' (kiss). It's from the verb 'suda' which means to kiss or smooch."
