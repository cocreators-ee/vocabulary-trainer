  "context": "The Estonian word 'fakt' is a noun that directly corresponds to the English word 'fact'. It refers to something that has actually happened or is really true, as opposed to speculation or opinion. In Estonian, it's often used in discussions, debates, and factual contexts where accuracy and truthfulness are important."
