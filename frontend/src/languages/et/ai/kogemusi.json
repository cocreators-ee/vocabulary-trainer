  "context": "The word 'kogemusi' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'kogenud', which means 'experiences'. In Estonian, the partitive case is often used with negative verbs or to indicate incomplete actions, but here it's likely being used in a more general sense referring to experiences as a concept. The word comes from the verb 'kogema' (to experience), and '-usi' indicates partitive plural form."
