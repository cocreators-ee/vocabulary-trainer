  "context": "The Estonian verb 'teadma' means to know or to have knowledge of something. It is used when someone has information about a fact, person, place, or situation. This verb indicates possession of knowledge rather than acquaintance with someone (which would use 'tundma'). The word can be conjugated in different tenses and forms: tean (I know), teadid (you knew), teavad (they know), etc."
