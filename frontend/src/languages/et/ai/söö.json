  "context": "The Estonian word 'magus' is an adjective that primarily means 'sweet' when referring to taste, but it has multiple other meanings depending on context. It can describe pleasant experiences (a sweet dream), attractive people or things (a sweet face), favorable time periods (a good moment for work), or charming/disarming behavior. The word changes form based on grammatical requirements - becoming 'magusad' in plural form, and having various case endings when used in different grammatical contexts."
