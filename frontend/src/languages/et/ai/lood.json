  "context": "The word 'lood' is an old Estonian weight measurement unit that equals 1/32 of an ounce or approximately 12.797 grams. It was commonly used in historical contexts for measuring small quantities of goods like silk and sugar, as seen in the example from R. Sirge's writing where it's mentioned alongside silk purchases."
