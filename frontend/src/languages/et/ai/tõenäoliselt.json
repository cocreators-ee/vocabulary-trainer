  "context": "The Estonian word 'tõenäoliselt' is an adverb that expresses probability or likelihood. It indicates that something is likely to happen or be true, but with some degree of uncertainty. The word can be translated into English as 'probably', 'likely', or 'perhaps'. In Estonian grammar, this adverb typically modifies verbs and appears before them in sentence structure."
