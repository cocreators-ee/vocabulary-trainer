It can mean: 1) seriously/gravely when describing appearance or expression (a child looking at someone seriously), 2) in earnest/not jokingly when talking about speech or attitude, 3) properly/carefully when referring to actions (practicing carefully), 4) actually/genuinely for emphasis, and 5) severely/deeply when describing emotions (being very worried). It's a versatile adverb that intensifies the seriousness or depth of whatever it modifies."
