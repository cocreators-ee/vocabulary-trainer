  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'tõsiselt' means seriously, earnestly, or solemnly. It is derived from the adjective 'tõsine' (serious) and describes how an action is taken - with seriousness, importance, or gravity. It modifies verbs to indicate that something is being done in a serious manner rather than jokingly or lightly."
