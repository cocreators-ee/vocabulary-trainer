  "context": "Ülejäänu is an Estonian word that means 'the remaining one(s)' or 'what remains'. It's a compound word formed from 'üle' (over/beyond) and 'jäänu' (left/remaining). This word typically refers to something that has been left over after some process, such as people who remain in a group after some have been captured or killed, or the remainder of a sum of money. It can be used for both singular and plural contexts depending on what it refers to."
