  "context": "The Estonian word 'õnne' is the genitive form of 'õnn', which means luck, fortune, or happiness. It's commonly used in expressions like 'Õnnega!' (With luck!) and as part of well-wishes. In the context provided in the dictionary definition, it appears to be related to a New Year's tradition called 'valama' where melted tin is poured into cold water, and the shapes formed are interpreted to predict events for the coming year. The word likely refers to the fortune or luck associated with this predictive ritual."
