  "context": "The Estonian word 'arv' has two main meanings: 1) a mathematical concept referring to an abstract entity used for counting, such as positive and negative numbers, integers, decimals, etc. 2) the grammatical category of number that indicates whether nouns refer to singular or plural objects. It can also be used more generally to mean 'quantity' or 'amount' when talking about counts of people, things, or events."
