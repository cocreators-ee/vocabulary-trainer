  "context": "In Estonian, 'hoolimata' is an adverb that means 'regardless' or 'despite'. It's used to indicate that something happens or is true in spite of certain conditions or obstacles. The word often appears in constructions like 'hoolimata + elativ case' (e.g., 'hoolimata takistestests' - despite the obstacles). It can be followed by other words in the elative case to show what is being disregarded."
