  "context": "The Estonian word 'jalga' has multiple meanings depending on its grammatical form. As a partitive singular of 'jalg', it means 'leg'. As an illative singular, it means 'to the leg'. However, in certain contexts (like the dictionary example), it can also mean '(secretly) to harm someone' or 'to stab in the back', as in the expression 'salaja jalga taha panna' meaning to secretly do something bad to someone."
