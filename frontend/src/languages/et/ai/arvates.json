  "context": "The word 'arvates' is the Estonian des-form of 'arvama' (to think). It functions as a postposition that means 'according to someone's opinion or belief'. This grammatical form indicates whose viewpoint or judgment something is based on. In English, it would typically be translated phrases like 'in my view', 'according to me', or 'from your perspective'. The word places the speaker's opinion or subjective assessment before the statement they are commenting on."
