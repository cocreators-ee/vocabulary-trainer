  "context": "The Estonian word 'väga' is an adverb used to emphasize the degree or intensity of a quality, action, or situation. It functions similarly to English words like 'very', 'extremely', or 'highly'. In Estonian grammar, it's not comparable and remains in its base form regardless of context. The word can modify adjectives (väga hea - very good), verbs (tuleks väga - would come very much), or even entire phrases. It's commonly used in everyday language to express various degrees of emphasis from mild to strong."
