  "context": "The word 'kohti' is a postposition in Estonian that indicates movement or direction towards a specific destination. It functions similarly to prepositions like 'towards' or 'to' in English, but follows the noun it modifies rather than preceding it. This is a common feature of Estonian where many case markers and direction indicators are suffixes or follow words rather than being separate words."
