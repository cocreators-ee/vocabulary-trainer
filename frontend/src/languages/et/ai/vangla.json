  "context": "Vangla is an Estonian noun meaning 'prison' or 'jail'. It refers to a detention facility for prisoners with custodial sentences. The word is derived from 'vang' (prisoner) and the suffix '-la', likely inspired by Finnish vankila. In Estonian grammar, it follows type 1 declension patterns, with forms like vanglas (in prison), vanglasse (into prison), and vanglast (from prison)."
