  "context": "The Estonian word 'ja' is a conjunction that primarily means 'and' in English. It's used to connect words, phrases, or clauses together in sentences. It can be used for listing items (like 'apples and bananas'), connecting similar ideas, joining compound subjects or predicates, and even indicating addition in numerical expressions. In modern usage with negative verbs, it's often replaced by 'ega'. The word is extremely common in Estonian and serves as the primary connector in compound structures."
