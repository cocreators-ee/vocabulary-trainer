  "context": "The Estonian word 'esimene' means 'first' in English. It is an adjective that indicates something comes before all others in a sequence or order. In Estonian grammar, adjectives need to agree with the noun they modify in case and number - for example, if referring to a feminine subject in the nominative case, it would be 'esimene naine' (first woman), but if referring to multiple people or objects, the plural form would be used. The word can be used to indicate priority, importance, or sequence."
