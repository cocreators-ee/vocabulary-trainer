  "context": "The Estonian word 'uksed' is the nominative plural form of 'uks', which means 'door'. In English, it translates to 'doors'. This refers to multiple door objects or entrances. The dictionary definition shows that this word can also refer to a corridor in some contexts, but based on the primary translation and etymology, 'uksed' primarily means doors."
