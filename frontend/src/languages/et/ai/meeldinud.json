It describes actions done contrary to the natural direction (like brushing fur or hair against its natural growth) or situations that are unpleasant, contrary to one's wishes. The term can be used both literally (when brushing hair/fur opposite its natural direction) and figuratively (for things that are disagreeable or unwelcome)."
