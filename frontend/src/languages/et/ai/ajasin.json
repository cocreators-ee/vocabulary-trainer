  "context": "'Ajasin' is the 1st person singular past tense form of the verb 'ajama'. It means to drive, push, chase, send someone somewhere, or make something move in a particular direction. This versatile Estonian verb can be used literally (driving vehicles, pushing objects) or figuratively (chasing people away, urging action). The word appears in contexts like driving bicycles ('jalgratast'), sending children to school ('kooli ajada'), and natural forces moving things like ice being driven ashore by wind."
