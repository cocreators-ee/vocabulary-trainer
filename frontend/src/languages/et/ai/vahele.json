  "context": "The Estonian word 'vahele' is a postposition that indicates placement or positioning between/among other objects, people, or time periods. It can be used spatially to show something being positioned between two things (like standing between me and someone else), temporally to indicate happening between certain times (events happening during breaks), or in figurative contexts showing interference or insertion into situations. The word has multiple nuances including physical positioning, temporal intervals, interpersonal relationships, and interruptive actions."
