It primarily means 'boy' or 'male child', but can also refer to a young man, son, helper/attendant (historically), or be used as an interjection of surprise or admiration. The word is masculine in gender and follows regular Estonian declension patterns with forms like poisi (genitive), poisid (plural nominative), etc."
