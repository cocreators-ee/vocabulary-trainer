  "context": "The Estonian word 'kurjategija' is a compound noun formed from 'kuri' (evil) and 'tegija' (doer). It refers to someone who has committed a crime or offense. The word can be used formally in legal contexts to describe criminals, but it can also be used more colloquially as an insult to refer to someone who has done something wrong or mischievous."
