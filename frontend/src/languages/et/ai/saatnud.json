  "context": "The word 'saatnud' appears to be a form of the Estonian word 'süüdlane' (guilty person/culprit). Based on the dictionary definitions provided, 'süüdlane' refers to someone who has committed a fault or harmful act. The word can function as both a noun (referring to the guilty person) and an adjective (describing something as being culpable or at fault). In Estonian grammar, '-nud' forms are typically past participles, suggesting 'saatnud' could be a past participle form meaning 'having been sent' or related to sending, but given the context provided focuses on 'süüdlane', it appears there may be some confusion in the word provided vs. the dictionary entries."
