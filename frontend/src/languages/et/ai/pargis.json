  "context": "The Estonian word 'pargis' is an inessive case form of 'park', meaning 'in the park'. It indicates location within something, and is formed by adding the '-s' suffix to the genitive stem 'pargi-'. The inessive case answers the question 'kus?' (where?) with a location inside something."
