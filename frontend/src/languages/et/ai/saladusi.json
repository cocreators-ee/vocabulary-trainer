  "context": "\"Saladusi\" is the partitive plural form of \"saladus\" (secret) in Estonian. The partitive case indicates an incomplete action or object, and when used with plural nouns like here, it suggests that we are talking about some secrets rather than all secrets. This word is commonly used when referring to multiple secrets in contexts where they might be partially revealed, shared, or discussed."
