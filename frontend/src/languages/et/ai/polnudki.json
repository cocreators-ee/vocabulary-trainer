  "context": "The word 'polnudki' is a combination of the past tense negative verb form 'polnud' (was/were not) and the particle 'ki' (also/either). It's used to emphasize that something was also not true, similar to saying 'wasn't either' or 'weren't either' in English. This construction is commonly used when adding additional information to contradict a previous statement or expectation."
