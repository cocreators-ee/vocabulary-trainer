  "context": "The word 'polnudki' is an Estonian negative construction that combines the past tense negation 'polnud' (was not) with the particle 'ki' (at all, really). It's used to emphasize that something definitely did not happen or was not true. The structure follows Estonian grammar where auxiliary verbs are placed before main verbs and particles can be added for emphasis."
