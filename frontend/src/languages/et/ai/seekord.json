  "context": "The Estonian word 'seekord' is an adverb that means 'this time', 'now', or 'on this occasion'. It indicates a specific occurrence of something in contrast to previous occasions. The word combines 'see-' (this) with '-kord' (time/occasion), literally meaning 'this time'. It's commonly used to emphasize that something is happening now, as opposed to before, and can be used at the beginning or middle of sentences."
