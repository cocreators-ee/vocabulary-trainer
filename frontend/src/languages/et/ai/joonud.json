  "context": "The Estonian word 'joonud' is the plural form of the past participle 'tõmmanud', which comes from the verb 'tõmmama'. It means to pull, draw, or drag something. This can be used in various contexts - literally pulling objects physically, drawing lines or shapes, inhaling smoke or air, or being drawn to something figuratively. The word appears in sentences describing horses pulling with all their strength, workers stretching/sighing (pulling a finger), and wind blowing through a chimney."
