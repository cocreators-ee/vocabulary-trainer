  "context": "The Estonian word 'aastane' is an adjective that has multiple related meanings: 1) indicating age of one year (used for people or animals), 2) something lasting a full year or occurring annually, and 3) accumulated or obtained over the course of a year. The form changes depending on usage - it remains 'aastane' in nominative case but becomes 'aastaseks' when indicating becoming that age (as in 'laps saab aastaseks' meaning 'the child becomes one-year-old')."
