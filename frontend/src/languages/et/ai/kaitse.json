  "context": "In Estonian, 'kaitse' primarily means defense or protection. It can refer to military defense (e.g., homeland defense), personal protection (e.g., protecting someone's interests), environmental protection (e.g., nature conservation), or even a protective device like an electrical circuit breaker. The word is declined in various forms depending on its grammatical function - as a noun it has genitive 'kaitse', partitive 'kaitset', and can be used in compound words like 'keskkonnakaitse' (environmental protection)."
