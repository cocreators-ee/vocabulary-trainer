  "context": "The Estonian verb 'tulistama' means to shoot or fire with a weapon. It comes from the root word 'tuli' meaning fire and the suffix '-stama'. This verb can be used in various contexts including military actions (shooting with rifles, machine guns), police actions (shooting at protesters), hunting (shooting animals), and even metaphorically (shooting questions or glances). The dictionary shows numerous examples of its usage including different grammatical forms like the present tense 'tulistan' (I shoot) and past tense 'tulistasin' (I shot)."
