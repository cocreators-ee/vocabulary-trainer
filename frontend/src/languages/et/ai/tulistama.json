  "context": "The word 'tulistama' is an Estonian verb that primarily means 'to shoot' or 'to fire' a weapon. In its infinitive form, it indicates the action of discharging a firearm. It can also be used in a non-literal sense to mean 'to release' or 'to put out', particularly when referring to releasing music albums or other creative works. The verb changes according to tense and subject conjugation - for example, 'tulistasin' is first person past singular (I shot), 'tulistame' is first person present plural (we shoot/are shooting)."
