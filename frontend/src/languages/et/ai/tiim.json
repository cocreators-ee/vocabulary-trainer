  "context": "The Estonian word 'tiim' is a loanword from English meaning 'team'. It refers to a group of people working together towards a common goal. The word is commonly used in both sports and business contexts in Estonia, often maintaining the same spelling as in English but with Estonian grammar rules applied (e.g., adding -i for plural or possessive forms)."
