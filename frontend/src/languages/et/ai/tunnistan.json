  "context": "The Estonian word 'tunnistan' is the first-person singular present form of the verb 'tunnistama', which means to acknowledge, admit, or confess. It is used when someone is admitting something as true, acknowledging a fact, or confessing to something they have done. The word derives from the same root as English 'testimony' and relates to bearing witness or making a statement of truth."
