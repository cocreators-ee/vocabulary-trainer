  "context": "The word 'kätt' is the partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'käsi', which means 'hand'. The partitive case is used to indicate partialness, indefiniteness, or the object of an action. In this case, 'kätt' can be translated as 'a hand' or 'some hand' and is often used when referring to a specific instance of a hand in various contexts such as describing its condition, taking something from someone's hand, or simply discussing hands in general."
