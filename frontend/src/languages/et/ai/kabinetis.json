  "context": "The word 'kabinetiinimene' is a compound noun in Estonian, combining 'kabinetis' (in the office/cabinet) with '-inimene' (-person). It refers to someone who works primarily or exclusively in an office setting, often implying they are solitary and detached from outside contact. The word suggests a person whose work is confined to indoor environments rather than fieldwork or public-facing roles."
