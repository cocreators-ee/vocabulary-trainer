  "context": "The Estonian word 'kell' has multiple meanings. It can refer to a physical bell (a hollow metal object that makes sound), a clock or watch for telling time, the actual time shown by a clock, and colloquially it can mean balls/testicles in plural form. The word comes from Proto-Germanic meaning 'bell'. In different contexts, it appears as 'kell' (nominative singular), 'kella' (genitive/partitive form), or 'kellad' (plural)."
