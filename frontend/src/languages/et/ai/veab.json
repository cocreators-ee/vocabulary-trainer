  "context": "The word 'ais' refers to the shafts or poles attached to a vehicle (like a cart, carriage, or sledge) that connect to the animal(s) pulling it. These are the wooden bars that go alongside an animal and allow it to pull or draw loads. In Estonian, it specifically means the shafts of carts, carriages, sledges, plows, etc., where draft animals are hitched between them."
