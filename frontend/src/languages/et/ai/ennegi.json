  "context": "The Estonian word 'ennegi' is used to express that something has not happened or been achieved up to the present moment. It functions as an adverb indicating a lack of completion, similar to English phrases like 'not yet', 'still not', or 'even so far'. The word typically appears in sentences where there's an expectation that something should have occurred but hasn't happened at the time of speaking."
