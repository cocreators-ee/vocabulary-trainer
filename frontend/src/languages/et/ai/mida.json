  "context": "The Estonian word 'mida' is an interrogative pronoun used to ask questions about things, objects, or concepts. It can be translated as 'what' in English when asking for information, but it also has other uses including as a relative pronoun meaning 'which' or 'that'. In sentences, it typically appears at the beginning of questions asking about the identity or nature of something."
