As a pronoun, it's the partitive form of 'mis', used interrogatively to mean 'what' when asking questions about objects or things in the accusative/partitive case. It can also be used relatively as a relative pronoun meaning 'that which' or 'the thing that'. Additionally, as an interjection, 'mida' expresses surprise or disbelief similar to English 'What?!'"
