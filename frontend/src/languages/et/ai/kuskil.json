  "context": "Kuskil is an Estonian adverb meaning 'somewhere' or 'anywhere'. It's used when the location is not precisely defined. In affirmative sentences, it indicates an unspecified location (e.g., 'I've seen him somewhere'). In negative sentences with 'mitte', it means 'not anywhere/nowhere' (e.g., 'He won't find peace anywhere'). It can also refer to an unspecified time period (e.g., 'This was sometime in the early 1950s')."
