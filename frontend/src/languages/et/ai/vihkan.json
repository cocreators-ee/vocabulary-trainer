  "context": "The word 'vihkan' is the first-person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'vihkama', meaning 'to hate'. It expresses a strong feeling of animosity or deep dislike toward someone or something. This can be directed at people (Ann vihkab Matit - Ann hates Matt) or things/ideas (Ma vihkan selliseid olukordi - I hate such situations). The word implies an intense, often passionate hatred rather than mild dislike."
