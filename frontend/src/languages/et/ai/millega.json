  "context": "The Estonian word 'millega' is the comitative singular form of 'mis', meaning it indicates accompaniment or instrumentality. It translates to English phrases like 'with which,' 'with whom,' or 'by means of which.' This grammatical case is used when you want to express what something is done with or accompanied by. For example, if asking about someone's companion ('With whom are you going?'), you would use 'millega sa tahad minna?'"
