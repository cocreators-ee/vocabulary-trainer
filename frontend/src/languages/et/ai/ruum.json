  "context": "The Estonian word 'ruum' has multiple related meanings. It can refer to physical space or room (as in a building), the concept of space and time as dimensions, an area or region, volume or capacity, and is also used as a clipping for 'ruumimeeter' (cubic meter). The word functions as both a countable noun (rooms) and uncountable noun (space/area), with various compound forms indicating different types of spaces."
