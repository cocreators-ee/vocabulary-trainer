  "context": "In Estonian, 'pardale' is an allative form of the word 'parda', which means 'duck'. The '-le' suffix indicates movement toward or arrival at a place. So 'pardale' specifically means 'to the duck' or 'toward the duck'. It's used when indicating direction towards a duck or ducks, typically in contexts where someone is going to or heading toward a duck."
