  "context": "The Estonian word 'ema' means mother or mom in English. It's a feminine noun that refers to one's female parent. In Estonian grammar, it would be in the nominative case here as no suffixes are shown. The word can take different forms when declined for cases (genitive, partitive, etc.) and numbers (plural would be 'emad')."
