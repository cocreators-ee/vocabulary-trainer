  "context": "The Estonian word 'ema' primarily means 'mother' - the female parent of a child. It can refer to both human mothers and female animals in relation to their offspring. The word has multiple compound forms like 'vanaema' (grandmother), 'kasuema' (stepmother), and 'emakeel' (native language). In different contexts, it can also metaphorically mean something that gives rise to or is the source of other things, similar to how we might say 'the mother of all problems' in English."
