  "context": "The Estonian word 'tõe' is the genitive singular form of the noun 'tõde', which means 'truth'. In the genitive case, it indicates possession or association, so 'tõe' can be translated as 'of truth', 'concerning truth', or related to the concept of truth. It's used to express that something belongs to or is about truth."
