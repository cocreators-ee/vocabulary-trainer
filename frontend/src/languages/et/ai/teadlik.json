  "context": "The Estonian word 'teadlik' is an adjective meaning 'aware' or 'conscious'. It describes someone who has knowledge of a situation, fact, or condition. The word comes from the root 'teada' (to know) and the suffix '-lik', which forms adjectives indicating a state or quality. When used with a person as subject, it indicates that they possess awareness or consciousness about something."
