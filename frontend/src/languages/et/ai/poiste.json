  "context": "The word 'poiste' is the plural genitive form of the Estonian noun 'poiss', which means 'boy'. In this case, it expresses possession or relationship, meaning 'of boys' or 'belonging to boys'. It can be translated as 'of the boys' or 'boys'' in English. The ending '-te' indicates the plural genitive case in Estonian."
