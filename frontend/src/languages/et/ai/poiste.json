  "context": "'Poiste' is the genitive plural form of 'poiss', which means 'boy'. In Estonian, the genitive case indicates possession or relationship - so 'poiste' translates to 'of the boys' or 'boys''. This form would be used when you want to show that something belongs to or is related to multiple boys. For example, in a sentence like 'Poiste rõõm oli näha' (The boys' joy was visible to see), where you're referring to the happiness belonging to the group of boys."
