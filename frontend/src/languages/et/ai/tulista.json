  "context": "The word 'tulista' is an Estonian verb that means to shoot or fire a weapon. It appears in the context of a sniper who doesn't shoot just approximately/indiscriminately ('umbkaudu'), but shoots precisely. This suggests it's used for firing weapons like guns, particularly with precision."
