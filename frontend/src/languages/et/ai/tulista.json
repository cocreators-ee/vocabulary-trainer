  "context": "The Estonian verb 'tulista' means to shoot or fire a weapon. It is used in contexts involving firearms, such as military actions, hunting, or describing shooting incidents. The word comes from the noun 'tuli' meaning fire, and the suffix '-sta' makes it an action verb indicating the act of firing/shooting."
