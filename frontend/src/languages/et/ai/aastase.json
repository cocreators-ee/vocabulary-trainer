  "context": "The word 'aastane' (in its adjectival form) refers to something that is annual or yearly, particularly in financial contexts. It describes an interest rate that applies over a one-year period and is commonly used when discussing loans, deposits, bonds, and other financial instruments where interest is calculated annually. The word comes from 'aasta' meaning 'year', with the suffix '-ne' making it an adjective."
