  "context": "The word 'surma' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'surm', which means 'death'. In this partitive form, it often appears in contexts where death is being discussed as a concept or object. For example, 'surmaga küsimus' means 'a question about death'. The word can also function adjectivally to indicate cause of death, as in 'ta suri haigusesse' (he died from illness), where the partitive indicates what caused the death."
