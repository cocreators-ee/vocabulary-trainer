  "context": "The Estonian word 'neist' is a partitive case form of the demonstrative pronoun 'need'. It functions as an adverbial phrase meaning 'of them', 'from among them', or 'about those'. In the partitive case, it indicates that we are talking about some members from a group of people or things. The word follows the same pattern other Estonian demonstrative pronouns like 'sellest' (of this) and 'sealt' (from there)."
