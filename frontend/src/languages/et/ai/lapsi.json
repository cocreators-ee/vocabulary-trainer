  "context": "The word 'lapsi' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'laps', which means 'child'. The partitive case in Estonian often indicates an incomplete or partial action, and when used with plural nouns it can indicate some children rather than all children. This form is commonly used after verbs of seeing, having, needing, etc."
