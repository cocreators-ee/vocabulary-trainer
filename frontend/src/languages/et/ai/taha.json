  "context": "The Estonian word 'taha' has multiple meanings depending on its grammatical function. As an adverb, it means 'behind' or 'to the back of', indicating position relative to something (e.g., 'Mine ukse taha!' - Go behind the door!). When used as a postposition with genitive case, it indicates location behind someone or something spatially ('Ta istus minu taha' - He sat behind me), temporally ('Need traditsioonid ulatuvad sajandite taha' - These traditions go back centuries), or figuratively representing support or causation ('Häälte koondumine ühiste kandidaatide taha' - The consolidation of votes behind common candidates). It can also indicate distance in space or time, and appear in various idiomatic expressions."
