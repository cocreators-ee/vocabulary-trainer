  "context": "In Estonian, 'maas' is the adessive case form of 'maa', meaning 'ground' or 'earth'. It's used to indicate that something is located on the ground surface or has fallen/lie down. The adessive case typically shows location on/in something, so here it indicates position relative to the ground."
