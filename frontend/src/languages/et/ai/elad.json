  "context": "The word 'elad' is the 2nd person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'elama', which means 'to live' or 'to reside'. It specifically refers to what someone currently does - where they live or how they live. In Estonian, as in other languages, verb conjugation changes based on the subject (who is living) and tense (when they live)."
