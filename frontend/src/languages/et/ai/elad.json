  "context": "The Estonian word 'elad' is the second-person singular present indicative form of the verb 'elama', meaning 'to live'. It corresponds to English 'you live' or 'you reside'. The dictionary definition shows it can be used in contexts asking about permanent versus temporary residence, such as whether someone lives permanently or temporarily in Tallinn. This verb form is specifically for addressing one person informally (singular) in the present tense."
