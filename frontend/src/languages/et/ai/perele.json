  "context": "The Estonian word 'perele' is an allative case form of the noun 'pere', which means 'family'. The allative case indicates direction or movement toward something, so 'perele' specifically means 'to the family' or 'toward the family'. It answers the question 'kuhu?' (where to?). This ending '-le' is commonly used in Estonian to indicate direction toward a person, place, or thing."
