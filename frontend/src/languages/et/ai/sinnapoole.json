  "context": "Sinnapoole is an Estonian adverb and preposition meaning 'to that side', 'in that direction', or 'towards there'. It indicates movement away from the speaker towards a specific location. As an adverb, it describes motion in a particular direction (e.g., 'Astu natuke sinnapoole' - Move a little to that side). As a preposition with partitive case, it can indicate spatial relationships (e.g., 'Kodu jäi sinnapoole merd' - The house remained on the other side of the sea) or temporal relationships (e.g., activities extending towards midnight). It's essentially directional, pointing away from the speaker's current position."
