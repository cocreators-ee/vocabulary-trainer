  "context": "The word 'ütleks' is the conditional mood (conditional tense) of the Estonian verb 'ütelda', which means 'to say'. It's used to express what someone would or might say under certain conditions. The '-ks' ending indicates the conditional form, similar to how English uses 'would' + base verb construction."
