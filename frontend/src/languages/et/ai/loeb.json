  "context": "The word 'loeb' is the third person singular present form of the Estonian verb 'lugema', which means 'to read'. It specifically refers to someone currently reading or who habitually reads. In Estonian, verbs conjugate based on person and number, so 'loeb' would be used for 'he/she/it reads' in English."
