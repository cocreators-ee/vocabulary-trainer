  "context": "The word 'sõbra' appears to be in the genitive case form of the Estonian noun 'sõber' which means 'friend'. In the example sentence 'Käis sõpra, koolivenda matmas', it's used as an object referring to a friend whose funeral is being attended. The -a ending indicates the partitive or genitive case in Estonian. This word denotes someone who is close and dear, like a companion or pal."
