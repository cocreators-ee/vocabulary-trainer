  "context": "The Estonian word 'sõbra' is the singular nominative form of 'sõber', which means 'friend'. It follows the genitive case pattern where -a is added to indicate possession or relationship. In the examples, it shows how this form is used in different contexts - describing a good friend, talking about having many friends (where the plural would be 'sõbrad'), and indicating something belonging to or related to a friend."
