  "context": "The Estonian word 'nina' has multiple meanings. Its primary meaning is 'nose', referring to the human and animal respiratory organ and sense of smell. It can also mean 'tip' or 'end part' (like a boat's prow), and in colloquial usage, it can refer to a person ('individual') or someone's ability/intuition ('instinct'). The word appears in various compound words describing different types of noses (straight nose, crooked nose) and can be used metaphorically for the front part of objects like boats, planes, mountains, etc. In children's language, it also refers to winged maple seeds that are worn on the tip of the nose."
