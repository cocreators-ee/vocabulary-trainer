  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõrval' has multiple meanings depending on context. As a postposition, it can mean 'next to', 'beside', or 'alongside' when referring to physical proximity (e.g., standing next to someone). It can also indicate addition or parallel activity alongside something else (e.g., doing construction work besides teaching). When used comparatively, it means 'compared to'. As an adverb, it means 'next to' physically or 'away from' in a figurative sense. The word is commonly used in everyday Estonian communication in these various contexts."
