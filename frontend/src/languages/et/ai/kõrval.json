  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõrval' is an adverb and preposition that indicates location or position beside something or next to something. It can be used to describe physical proximity, such as when one object is located adjacent to another. For example, if a building is 'kooli kõrval', it means the building is beside the school. The word doesn't change form in different cases and maintains its meaning regardless of gender or number."
