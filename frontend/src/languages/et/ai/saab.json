  "context": "The Estonian word 'saab' is the 3rd person singular form of the verb 'saa', which means 'to get' or 'to receive'. It's commonly used in different contexts: 1) To indicate ability/capacity ('can', 'is able to') - e.g., 'Ta saab hästi lugeda' (He can read well); 2) To indicate receiving/getting something - e.g., 'Laps sai kingi' (The child got a gift); and 3) In expressions like 'saama hakkama' (to manage, to cope). The verb is irregular in Estonian and has multiple forms depending on context."
