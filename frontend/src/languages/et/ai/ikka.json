  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'ikka' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'always' (mainly in affirmative clauses), indicating something happens repeatedly or is a constant state. It can also mean 'still' when referring to an ongoing situation, or 'yet' for uncompleted actions. Additionally, it's used emphatically as 'nevertheless' or 'of course'. The word derives from the illative case form of 'iga' (age) and often appears in phrases like 'ikka ja jälle' (time and again)."
