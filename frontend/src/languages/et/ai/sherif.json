  "context": "The word 'sherif' in Estonian is a loanword from English meaning 'sheriff'. It refers to a law enforcement official, typically the chief law enforcement officer of a county or local area who has authority over criminal matters and maintains public order. In Estonia, this term would be used to refer to foreign sheriffs or in contexts discussing American/Western law enforcement systems."
