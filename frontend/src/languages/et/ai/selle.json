  "context": "The Estonian word 'selle' is a demonstrative pronoun in the genitive case. It can mean 'this', 'that', or 'these' depending on context, and indicates possession or association with something previously mentioned. In English grammar terms, it would function like saying 'of this', 'of that', or referring to something specific but not explicitly stating ownership."
