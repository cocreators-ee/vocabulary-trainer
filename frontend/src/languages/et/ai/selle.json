  "context": "The Estonian word 'selle' is the genitive singular form of the demonstrative pronoun 'see'. It functions as a possessive or specifying adjective, meaning 'of this' or 'belonging to this'. In English, it can translate to 'this one' or 'that one' depending on context. The genitive case indicates possession or relationship - what belongs to or is associated with the thing being referred to."
