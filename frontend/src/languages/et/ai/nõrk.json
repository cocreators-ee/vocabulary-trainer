  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'nõrk' means weak and is used in various contexts to describe things that lack strength, intensity, quality or effectiveness. It can refer to physical weakness (of people, animals), structural fragility (of objects, materials), diminished power (of natural forces, signals), poor performance (in academic or professional settings), or inadequate results. The word appears in different forms depending on grammatical case - for example 'nõrga' is the genitive form meaning 'of weak' or 'with a weak'."
