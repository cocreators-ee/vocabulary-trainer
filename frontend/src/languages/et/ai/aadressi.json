  "context": "The word 'aadressi' is the partitive case form of 'aadress' (address) in Estonian. It typically appears after verbs like 'adresseerima' (to address/direct). In the given context, it functions as an object indicating what is being addressed or directed - essentially meaning 'an address' but used with directional force to show that something is sent or aimed toward a specific destination or recipient."
