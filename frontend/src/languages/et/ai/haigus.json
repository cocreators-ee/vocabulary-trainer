  "context": "The Estonian word 'haigus' primarily refers to an illness, disease or sickness affecting the normal functioning of an organism. It's a noun that can be used in various forms (genitive: haiguse, partitive: haigust). The word also has a secondary meaning referring to a strong passion or obsession, but this is less common and typically found in compound words like 'jalgpallihaigus' (football obsession) or 'moehaigus' (fashion obsession)."
