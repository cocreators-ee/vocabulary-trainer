  "context": "The word 'silmad' is the plural form of 'silma' (eye) in Estonian. It refers to the organs of sight on a person's face, used for vision and seeing. In Estonian grammar, this follows the regular declension pattern where words ending in -d typically indicate plural forms. The word can be used literally to refer to physical eyes or metaphorically in expressions about appearance or perception."
