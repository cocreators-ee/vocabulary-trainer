  "context": "The word 'katsu' in Estonian is an interjection similar to English expressions like 'Look!', 'See!', or 'Take a look!' used to draw attention to something interesting, surprising, or noteworthy. It often appears with the phrase 'kas sa näed' (can you see) and is followed by showing something remarkable. The dictionary example shows it used in an expression where someone discovers they both share the same name."
