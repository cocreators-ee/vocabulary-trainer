  "context": "The word 'kuulanud' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'kuulma', which means 'to hear' or 'to listen'. As a past participle, it indicates that someone has already heard something in the past. It's commonly used with auxiliary verbs like 'olema' (to be) to form compound tenses, such as 'olen kuulanud' meaning 'I have heard'. The word reflects the completion of an action - hearing/listening - that occurred prior to the moment of speaking."
