  "context": "The Estonian word 'abil' is an adessive case form used to indicate that something was done with the help or assistance of someone or something. It functions as a postposition and typically follows the noun it modifies, similar to English expressions like 'with the help of' or 'by means of'. The base form would be 'abi' (help), and 'abil' indicates the adessive case, meaning 'on/with help'."
