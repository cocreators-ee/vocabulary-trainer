  "context": "The Estonian word 'abil' is a postposition that indicates the means or instrument through which something is done. It translates to English words like 'with', 'using', 'by means of', and shows how an action is performed with the help, assistance, or use of something else. It functions similarly to the adessive case in Estonian grammar."
