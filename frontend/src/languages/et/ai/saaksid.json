  "context": "The word 'saaksid' is the conditional form of the verb 'saa' meaning 'to get/receive/understand'. It's used in Estonian to make polite requests or ask about possibilities. The form combines the subject 'sa' (you) with the conditional '-ksid' ending, creating a soft, indirect way of asking someone if they are able to do something. This construction is commonly used for making requests sound more courteous and less demanding."
