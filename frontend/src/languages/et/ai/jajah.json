  "context": "The Estonian word 'jajah' is an informal or colloquial way of saying 'yes', similar to how 'yeah' or 'yep' are used in English. It's often used in casual conversation and can be seen as a more relaxed version of the standard Estonian word for yes, which is 'jah'. This form might appear in subtitles where characters are speaking informally."
