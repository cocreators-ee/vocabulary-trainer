  "context": "The Estonian word 'jajah' is an adverb that expresses strong affirmation or concession. It's used to give a positive, emphatic answer that goes beyond a simple 'jah' (yes). The word carries additional emphasis, confirming something with certainty and often implies agreement with what was said before it."
