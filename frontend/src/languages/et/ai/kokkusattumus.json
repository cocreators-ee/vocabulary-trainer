  "context": "The Estonian word 'kokkusattumus' is a noun that refers to an occurrence or event that happens by chance rather than through deliberate planning. It describes situations where things come together unexpectedly, often without any apparent reason or connection between the events involved. The word comes from 'kokku' (together) and 'sattuma' (happen), literally meaning something that 'happens together'. In English, this can be translated as coincidence, accident, chance encounter, or fortuitous event."
