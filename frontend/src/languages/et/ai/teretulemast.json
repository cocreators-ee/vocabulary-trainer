  "context": "The Estonian word 'teretulemast' is a compound word meaning 'welcome'. It's formed from 'tere' (greetings/hello) and 'tulemast' (come). This is the plural/formal welcome expression in Estonian, commonly used when greeting guests or welcoming someone to an event or place. The literal translation would be something like 'hello come', but it functions as a warm welcome phrase similar to English 'welcome'."
