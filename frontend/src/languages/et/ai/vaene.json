  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaene' primarily means 'poor' or 'impoverished' when referring to a person's financial situation. It can also be used in an empathetic sense to express pity for someone in difficult circumstances, and metaphorically to describe something as lacking quality, richness, or abundance (e.g., 'vaene põllumaa' means poor soil). The word can function both as an adjective ('poor man') and a noun referring to poor people. In comparative form it becomes 'vaesem' (poorer) and in superlative 'kõige vaesem' (the poorest)."
