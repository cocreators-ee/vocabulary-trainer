  "context": "The Estonian word 'neiu' refers to a young unmarried woman, teenager, or slightly older girl. It can be used both literally to describe the age and marital status of a female person, and colloquially as an address to young women. The word shows grammatical variation in different cases (like genitive neiu, partitive neiut) and has several compound forms with specific occupations."
