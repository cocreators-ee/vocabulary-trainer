  "context": "The Estonian word 'ärkvel' is an adverb that means 'awake' or 'not in a sleep state'. It describes someone who is conscious, alert, and not asleep. The word can refer to being physically awake but also metaphorically refers to mental awareness or alertness. For example, it's used when someone needs to stay awake due to illness ('Haiget ei tohi lasta magama jääda, teda tuleb hoida ärkvel' - A sick person must not be allowed to fall asleep, they must be kept awake) or when referring to heightened mental state ('Meeled olid ärkvel' - The senses were alert/awake)."
