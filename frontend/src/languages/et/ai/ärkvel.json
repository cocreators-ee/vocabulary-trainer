  "context": "The Estonian word 'ärkvel' means awake or conscious. It's used to describe someone who is no longer asleep and has regained consciousness. The word comes from the verb 'ärkama' which means to wake up. When describing a person as 'ärkvel', it indicates they are fully conscious and aware of their surroundings, not just physically awake but mentally alert as well."
