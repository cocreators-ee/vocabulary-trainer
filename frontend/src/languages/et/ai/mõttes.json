  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõttes' is the inessive case (inessiiv) form of the noun 'mõte', which means 'thought'. It indicates being inside or within something, so 'mõttes' literally translates to 'in thought' or 'mentally'. This form is used to express that someone is thinking about something mentally or that something exists in one's mind. For example, when you want to say 'I am thinking about it' or 'It exists in my thoughts', you would use the inessive case form 'mõttes'."
