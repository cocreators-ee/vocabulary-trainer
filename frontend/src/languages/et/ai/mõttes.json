  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõttes' is an adessive case form of the noun 'mõte', which means 'thought'. In this form, it functions as an adverb meaning 'in thought', 'mentally', or 'in someone's mind'. It indicates where something exists in a conceptual or mental sense rather than physically. The word can also convey a thoughtful manner or be used to specify whose thoughts are being referred to."
