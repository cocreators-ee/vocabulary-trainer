  "context": "The Estonian word 'sell' has multiple meanings. Historically, it referred to a craftsman who had completed their apprenticeship and was working under a master (between apprentice and master). In modern usage, it can mean a shop assistant or helper in a store, pharmacy, etc. The word is also used colloquially to describe people informally, similar to 'guy' or 'fellow', and sometimes to describe animals when referring to their temperament or characteristics."
