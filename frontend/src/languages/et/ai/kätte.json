  "context": "In Estonian, 'kätte' is the partitive form of käsi (hand), used when something is being handed to someone or given into their hands. It indicates that an object is being received by someone's hands, similar to English expressions like 'into one's hands' or 'to hand over'. The word appears in contexts where someone receives something physically or metaphorically."
