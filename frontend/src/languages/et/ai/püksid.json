  "context": "The Estonian word 'püksid' is the nominative plural form of 'püks', meaning pants or trousers. It's used to refer to a pair of pants in their basic form, not specifying any particular type or condition. In English, this would be translated as 'pants' or 'trousers'. The singular form 'püks' would mean a single pant leg, but the plural form 'püksid' is commonly used for the garment as a whole item."
