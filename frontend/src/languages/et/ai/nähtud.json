  "context": "The Estonian word 'nähtud' is the past participle form of the verb 'näha' (to see/watch). It indicates that an action of seeing or watching has been completed. As a past participle, it can be used in perfect tenses or as an adjective to describe something that has been seen. The word follows Estonian grammatical patterns for participles and agrees with the subject in gender, number, and case when used adjectivally."
