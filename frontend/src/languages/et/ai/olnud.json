  "context": "The word 'olnud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'olema', which means 'to be'. It functions as the third-person singular past perfect form and can indicate that someone or something was in a particular state or location at some point in the past. It's commonly used with auxiliary verbs to form compound tenses."
