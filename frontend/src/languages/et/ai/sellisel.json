  "context": "The Estonian word 'sellisel' is the adessive case form of the demonstrative pronoun 'selline', which means 'such'. It indicates location or circumstance, showing that something happens in a particular manner or under specific conditions. The '-sel' ending marks it as being in the adessive case, similar to how English uses phrases like 'in this way' or 'under these circumstances'."
