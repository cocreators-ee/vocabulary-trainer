  "context": "The Estonian word 'tuleks' is a conditional form of the verb 'tulema' (to come). It's commonly used to express suggestions, recommendations, or hypothetical situations. In English, it translates well to modal verbs like 'should', 'ought to', or 'would have to'. This form appears in questions asking for advice or making polite suggestions."
