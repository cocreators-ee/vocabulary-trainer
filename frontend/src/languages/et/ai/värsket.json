  "context": "The Estonian word 'värsket' is the adessive case (ending -el) form of 'värske', meaning 'fresh'. The adessive case typically indicates location or means 'at/with/on something'. In this context, 'värsket' would mean 'with freshness' or 'in a fresh state', but it's commonly used to simply modify nouns to indicate they are fresh. It can refer to food that is recently made/harvested, news that is current, or things that are new and unspoiled."
