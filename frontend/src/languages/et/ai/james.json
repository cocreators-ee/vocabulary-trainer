  "context": "The word 'james' is a proper noun in Estonian, specifically a name of English origin. It's used to refer to someone named James and functions the same way as it does in English-speaking countries. In Estonian grammar, names typically don't change form regardless of case or number - they remain 'James' whether referring to one person or multiple people."
