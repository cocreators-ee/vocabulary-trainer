  "context": "The word 'meest' is the elative case form of Estonian noun 'mees', meaning 'from a man'. The elative case indicates movement or origin from something. In this case, it would translate to English as 'from a man' or 'out of a man'. This is one of the 14 grammatical cases in Estonian that modifies nouns to show different relationships."
