  "context": "In Estonian, 'arvata' is a verb that means to form an opinion or judgment without complete certainty. It can be translated as 'to guess', 'to suppose', or 'to assume'. The word appears in various contexts where there's an element of uncertainty - from simple guessing about something unknown to making assumptions based on available information. The verb follows regular Estonian conjugation patterns, with forms like 'aran' (I guess), 'arvad' (you guess), and so on."
