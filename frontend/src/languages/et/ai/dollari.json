  "context": "The word 'dollari' is the Estonian genitive singular form of the noun 'dollar', which means a unit of currency, particularly the US dollar. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case typically indicates possession or origin. So 'dollari' can mean 'of the dollar' or 'belonging to the dollar'. It's commonly used when talking about money exchange rates, prices in dollars, or referring specifically to the currency."
