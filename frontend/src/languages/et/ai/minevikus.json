  "context": "The Estonian word 'minevikus' is an adverbial form that means 'in the past' or 'previously'. It's derived from the noun 'minevik' which means 'past', and the '-s' suffix makes it into an inessive case form indicating location or time within something. In this case, it indicates temporal location within the past period."
