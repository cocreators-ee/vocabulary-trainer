  "context": "The Estonian word 'viisi' is part of the illative case form of the word 'viis', which means 'way' or 'method'. In English, it can be translated as 'way', 'method', 'manner', or 'fashion'. It refers to a particular manner in which something is done, approached, or carried out. The illative case indicates movement into or direction towards something, so 'viisi' often appears with verbs indicating action or approach."
