  "context": "The word 'vanasti' is an Estonian adverb meaning 'formerly,' 'once upon a time,' or 'in the past.' It refers to times long ago, before the present. The word can be used both literally (referring to historical periods) and metaphorically (comparing current behavior with past behavior). It's often used when describing how things were different in earlier times."
