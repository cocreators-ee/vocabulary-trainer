  "context": "The word 'vanasti' is an Estonian adverb that means 'often' or 'frequently'. It indicates the frequency of occurrence of actions or events. In Estonian grammar, '-sti' is a common suffix for forming adverbs from adjectives, though in this case it's derived from the adjective 'vana' (old/veteran) but has taken on a temporal meaning related to frequent or repeated action over time."
