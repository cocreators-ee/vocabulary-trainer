  "context": "The Estonian word 'laipa' is used in two main contexts. First, it refers to the physical act of cutting open or dissecting something, particularly for examination - like performing an autopsy on a body or preparing fish by cutting it open along its belly. Second, it can be used metaphorically to mean analyzing or examining something closely, as when a literary review analyzes the merits and flaws of a book."
