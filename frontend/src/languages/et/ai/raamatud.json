  "context": "\"Raamatud\" is the plural nominative form of the Estonian word \"raamat\", which means \"book\". In this form, it refers to multiple books or books in general. The word comes from the same root as many other European words for book (like English \"book\", German \"Buch\", etc.) and follows typical Estonian plural formation patterns."
