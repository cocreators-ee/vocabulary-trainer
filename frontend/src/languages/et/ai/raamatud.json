  "context": "The word 'raamatud' is the plural form of the Estonian noun 'raamat', which means 'book'. In Estonian, nouns have different forms for singular and plural. The suffix '-d' added to 'raamat' indicates that we are talking about multiple books rather than just one. This word would be used when referring to a collection of books or multiple volumes in general."
