  "context": "The word 'elavad' is the third-person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'elama', which means 'to live'. It translates to English as 'live' or 'living' and is used when talking about multiple people or things that currently exist or are alive. For example, it could refer to living pictures (as in the historical context of early films), or more commonly to living people who reside in certain places."
