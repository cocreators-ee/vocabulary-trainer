  "context": "The word 'otsinud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'otsima', which means 'to look for' or 'to search'. It indicates a completed action in the past. In the dictionary definition provided, it appears as part of a longer compound word describing a historical movement, but on its own, 'otsinud' specifically refers to the action of having looked for or searched for something in the past."
