  "context": "The Estonian word 'jää' means 'ice' in English. It refers to the frozen form of water. In addition to being a noun meaning 'ice', it can also be used as a verb stem meaning 'to freeze' or 'to become ice'. For example, when water freezes, we say that it 'muutub jääks' (becomes ice). The word is commonly used in everyday contexts to talk about winter conditions, frozen bodies of water, and cold temperatures."
