  "context": "\"Tulevad\" is the 3rd person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb \"tulla\", which means \"to come\". It indicates that a group of people or things are coming in the present moment, but with future implications (similar to the English present continuous for future actions). The word can be translated as \"come\", \"are coming\", or \"will come\" depending on context. It's commonly used to announce arrival or ask about expected arrivals."
