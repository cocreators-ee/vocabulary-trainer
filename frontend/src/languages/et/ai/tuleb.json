  "context": "The Estonian word 'tuleb' is the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb 'tulema', which means 'to come'. It can be translated as 'comes', 'will come', or 'happens to come'. In some contexts, particularly in expressions like 'aru pähe tuleb' (meaning understanding/comprehension comes into one's head), it conveys the idea of something coming to mind or becoming clear."
