  "context": "The Estonian word 'tuleb' is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb 'tulla' meaning 'to come'. It can be used both literally to indicate arrival or movement toward a location, and also in an auxiliary sense to express obligation or necessity similar to English 'must' or 'has to'. The form depends on context - it may be followed by temporal expressions like 'homme' (tomorrow) for future arrangements, or interrogative structures asking what needs to be done."
