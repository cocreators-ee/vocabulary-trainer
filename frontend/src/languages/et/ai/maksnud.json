  "context": "The word 'maksnud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'maksma', which means 'to pay'. It indicates that the action of paying has been completed. The '-nud' suffix in Estonian creates past participles, similar to how English uses '-ed' for regular verbs or irregular forms like 'paid'. This word is typically used with auxiliary verbs like 'on' (has) or 'olen' (have) to form compound tenses in the present perfect tense."
