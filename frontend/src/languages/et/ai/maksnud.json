  "context": "In Estonian, 'maksnud' is the past participle form of the verb 'maksma', which means to pay or to cost. In this context from the dictionary definition, it's used in a phrase where something wouldn't have been worth getting excited about ('poleks maksnud erutuda'), meaning it wasn't worth becoming agitated over such a trivial matter."
