  "context": "The word 'tööta' is an Estonian adjective that means 'honorary' or 'unpaid'. It describes a position or role that is held as an honor without financial compensation. The dictionary definition specifically mentions it in the context of 'auamet' (honorary position), indicating it's used to describe roles like chairman of a society that are filled out of prestige rather than for salary."
