It means 'of the project' or 'project's' and indicates possession or relation to a project. In English, it would typically be translated as 'project's' when showing possession (e.g., 'the project's goal') or as 'of the project' when indicating something belongs to or is part of a project (e.g., 'parts of the project')."
