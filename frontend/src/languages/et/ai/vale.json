  "context": "The Estonian word 'vale' has multiple meanings: it can be an adjective meaning 'false', 'incorrect', or 'wrong', and also a noun meaning 'lie'. As an adjective, it refers to something that is not true or does not correspond to reality (e.g., showing the wrong time). As a noun, it refers specifically to a false statement or deliberate untruth. The word can be declined in various cases depending on how it's used in a sentence."
