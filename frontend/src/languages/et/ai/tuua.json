  "context": "The word 'tuua' is the da-infinitive form of the Estonian verb 'tulla', which means 'to come'. It's used to indicate movement toward a speaker or listener, similar to how we might use 'come' in English when inviting someone to approach. The basic meaning involves approaching from some other location to where the speaker currently is."
