  "context": "The Estonian verb 'tuua' means to bring or to fetch something/someone. It can refer to bringing something from one place to another, fetching someone, or bringing someone along with you. In the first example sentence, it's used in past tense (tulin) meaning 'I came/brought'. The second sentence is an imperative form telling someone to come here ('bring yourself here'). The third sentence uses the infinitive form asking how to bring one's child to work."
