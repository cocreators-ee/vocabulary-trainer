  "context": "The word 'lihtsam' is the comparative form of 'lihtne', meaning 'simple'. As a comparative, it means 'easier' or 'simpler'. It's used when comparing two things and indicating that one has more of the quality of simplicity than the other. The '-sam' ending in Estonian typically forms comparatives, similar to how English adds '-er' to adjectives like 'simple' to become 'simpler'."
