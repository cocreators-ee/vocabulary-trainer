  "context": "The Estonian word 'teid' is the partitive case form of the pronoun 'te', meaning 'you'. It's used when referring to multiple people or using formal address. In English, it translates to 'you' in contexts where the object is plural or formal. The partitive case often indicates partialness or indefiniteness, but with pronouns like 'teid', it typically functions as the accusative/object form."
