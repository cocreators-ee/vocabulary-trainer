  "context": "Tegija is an Estonian noun that has multiple related meanings. Primarily it means 'doer' - someone who performs or carries out actions. It can also refer to a successful, skilled, or active person in their field of expertise. The word is formed from the verb 'tegema' (to do/make) plus the suffix '-ja', which typically forms agent nouns indicating a person who performs an action."
