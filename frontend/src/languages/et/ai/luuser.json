  "context": "The Estonian word 'luuser' is a loanword from English 'loser'. It refers to someone who is unsuccessful, incompetent, or fails to achieve what others expect. It's often used in informal contexts and can be somewhat pejorative when referring to someone who consistently performs poorly socially, academically, or in other areas where success is measured."
