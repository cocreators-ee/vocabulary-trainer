  "context": "The Estonian word 'korrus' refers to a floor or storey in a building. It's used to indicate different levels within a structure, such as the first floor (esimene korrus), second floor (teine korrus), etc. The word can be declined in various cases depending on how it's used in a sentence. In Estonian buildings, unlike some other countries, the ground floor is typically called 'esimene korrus' rather than 'kõige alumine korrus'."
