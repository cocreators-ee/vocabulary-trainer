  "context": "The Estonian word 'alati' is an adverb that means 'always'. It can indicate something happening every time, constantly throughout all time, or in some contexts as a strong affirmation meaning 'definitely' or 'without fail'. The word appears to have Proto-Finnic origins and is commonly used in everyday Estonian speech."
