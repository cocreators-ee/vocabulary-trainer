  "context": "Söönud is the past participle of the Estonian verb 'sööma' (to eat). It's formed by adding the -d suffix to the stem, indicating a completed action. This form is commonly used in perfect tenses with auxiliary verbs like 'olema' (to be) to express that eating has taken place in the past. For example: 'Olen söönud' means 'I have eaten', 'Ta on söönud' means 'He/She has eaten'. The word agrees with the subject in number and gender when used with auxiliary verbs."
