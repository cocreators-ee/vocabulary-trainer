It's commonly used when someone wants to express regret for something they've done said or ask for forgiveness. The word can stand alone as 'Vabandust!' which means 'Sorry!' or 'Excuse me!'. In other forms, it can be part of longer sentences where someone is apologizing for an action or requesting forgiveness."
