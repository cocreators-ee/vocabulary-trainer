  "context": "The Estonian verb 'mäleta' means to remember or recall something. It is the active form of memory - when someone remembers something. The word comes from the same root as 'mälu' (memory). In the example sentences, it's used in different contexts: asking someone to remember you, not remembering a name, and recalling what was done yesterday. Note that this appears to be the colloquial/spoken form of the more standard Estonian verb 'meelde tuletama'."
