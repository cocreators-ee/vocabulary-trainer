  "context": "The word 'jumalale' is the allative case form of 'Jumala', which means 'God'. In Estonian grammar, the allative case (-le suffix) indicates motion toward or destination. So 'jumalale' specifically means 'to God' or 'toward God', indicating movement in the direction of God or something being given to/for God. It's used when expressing actions directed toward God, such as prayer, giving thanks, or making requests."
