  "context": "The Estonian word 'eksinud' is the past participle form of the verb 'eksima', meaning to get lost or go astray. It describes someone who has been lost, stranded, or wandering without finding their way. This word can be used in various contexts - for people getting lost in physical locations (forest, city), but also metaphorically for feeling lost or disoriented."
