  "context": "The Estonian word 'kasuta' is the imperative form of the verb 'kasutama', which means 'to use'. It's an instruction or command telling someone to use something. This form is used when directly addressing someone in a commanding way, similar to 'use!' in English but more commonly expressed as just 'use' without the exclamation mark in Estonian imperative constructions."
