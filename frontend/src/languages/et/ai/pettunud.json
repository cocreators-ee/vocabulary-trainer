  "context": "The word 'pettunud' is the Estonian past participle form of the verb 'pettada', meaning to disappoint or let down. It describes a state of feeling disappointed, frustrated, or let down by someone or something. In the context provided, it seems there might be some confusion with the dictionary entry which actually defines 'hipi' (meaning hippie) rather than 'pettunud'. The word 'pettunud' itself has no connection to hippies or counterculture movements - it purely refers to a feeling of disappointment."
