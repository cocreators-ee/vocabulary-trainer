  "context": "'Olid' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'olema' (to be), specifically used in second-person singular (you were) and third-person plural (they were) contexts. It indicates a state or existence that existed in the past. In first example, it means 'Your parents were'; in second, 'Our children were'; in third, 'You were'. This word shows how Estonian verbs conjugate differently based on person and number."
