It's specifically addressing multiple people in a familiar/informal way ('teie' with plural imperative ending). In the given context, it's used as a wake-up call addressing someone who appears to be sleeping like a cat (a 'sleeping bag'), telling them to get up because the sun is already halfway through its journey across the sky."
