  "context": "The Estonian word 'lähemalt' is an adverb that means 'more closely' or 'in more detail'. It is derived from the root word 'lähedane' (near/close) with the comparative suffix '-em-' and the adverbial ending '-lt', forming a comparative degree adverb used to indicate examining something in greater proximity or with more thoroughness than before."
