  "context": "The Estonian word 'viha' has multiple meanings. Primarily it refers to anger, rage or hatred as a strong emotion associated with hostility and irritation. It can also describe bitter taste, the effect or power of something, and in some contexts even means decay or rot. The word is used both as a noun (viha) and an adjective form (vihane = angry). Examples show its use in emotional contexts ('fiery anger took hold of him'), in expressions of avoiding someone's wrath ('fled from the king's anger'), and to describe taste ('apples were bitter')."
