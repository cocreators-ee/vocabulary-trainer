  "context": "The Estonian word 'asjad' is the plural form of 'asi' (thing). It refers to physical objects, personal belongings, or matters/situations in life. In the example sentences, it appears to be used both literally for possessions and metaphorically for situations or circumstances. The first sentence from Tammsaare suggests that things are a certain way with/about the girl, while the second shows someone saying 'my affairs/things have already reached this point.'"
