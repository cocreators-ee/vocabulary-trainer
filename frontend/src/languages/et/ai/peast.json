  "context": "The word 'peast' in Estonian is used as both an elative case form of 'pea' (head) and as a postposition/adverb with multiple meanings. It can mean 'from the head,' 'by heart' when referring to memorized knowledge, or 'from memory.' The examples show it being used in different contexts - one showing confusion from being sleepy, another showing recitation of poems that must be memorized."
