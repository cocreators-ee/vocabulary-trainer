  "context": "The Estonian word 'peast' is an adverb that means 'from memory', 'by heart', or 'from the head'. It's used to indicate that something is being recalled without using written materials, or to specify that information comes from verbal communication rather than written sources. The word derives from the partitive case of ' pea' (head), indicating origin or source."
