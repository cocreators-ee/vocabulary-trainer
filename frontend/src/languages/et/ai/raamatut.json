  "context": "\"Raamatut\" is the partitive case form of \"raamat\" (book) in Estonian. The partitive case is used when we don't have a complete, whole object - it can indicate an incomplete action, some amount of something, or an object being acted upon without specifying the exact quantity. In this case, \"raamatut\" would be used with verbs like 'loen' (I read) to indicate reading some/a book, rather than reading all books or a complete set."
