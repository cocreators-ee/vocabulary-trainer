  "context": "The Estonian word 'aeglaselt' is an adverb derived from the adjective 'aeglane' (meaning 'slow'). It describes actions or processes that happen at a slow pace. The '-lt' ending indicates it's in the abessive case, which in this context modifies the adjective to form an adverb meaning 'in a slow manner'. It can be used with comparative forms like 'aeglasemalt' (more slowly)."
