  "context": "The word 'hingeldus' refers to rapid or heavy breathing, often occurring as a symptom of illness or physical exertion. It describes a condition where breathing is faster and more labored than normal. The Estonian suffix '-e' indicates the nominative case here. In the example sentences, it shows how this condition affects speech ('raske rääkida' - difficult to speak) and can be consciously suppressed."
