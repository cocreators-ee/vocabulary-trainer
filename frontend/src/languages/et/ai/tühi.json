  "context": "The Estonian word 'tühi' is an adjective that means empty, blank, or hollow. It can describe physical spaces (like an empty room), containers with nothing inside them, or abstract concepts like an empty mind or void. The word changes form based on case and number - for example in the nominative case it's 'tühi', but in other cases it would change appropriately to fit Estonian grammar rules."
