  "context": "\"Ongi\" is an Estonian emphatic form of the word \"on\" (is/am/are). It adds emphasis or confirmation to a statement, similar to saying \"indeed it is\" or \"that's exactly what it is\" in English. The particle \"gi\" intensifies the basic meaning of \"on\", making the statement more certain and affirmative."
