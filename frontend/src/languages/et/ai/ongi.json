  "context": "The Estonian word 'ongi' is an intensifier particle that emphasizes the truth or certainty of a statement. It's commonly used to add emphasis, similar to saying 'indeed', 'already', or 'exactly' in English. This particle typically follows the verb and serves to confirm or strengthen what has been said."
