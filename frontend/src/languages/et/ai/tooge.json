  "context": "The word 'tooge' is the imperative form of the Estonian verb 'tulema' meaning 'to come'. However, in this context it appears to be used incorrectly or there may be a misunderstanding. The correct Estonian verb for 'bring' would be 'too/a', with 'tooge' being the 2nd person plural imperative form meaning 'you bring/fetch/carry'."
