  "context": "The Estonian word 'rada' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can refer to a physical path or track that people or animals have made (like a footpath, trail, or track), but also metaphorically means someone's life course, way of doing things, or the route they take in life. In sports contexts, it refers specifically to competition courses for events like skiing, racing, or orienteering. It can also mean runway at airports or a boundary/limit."
