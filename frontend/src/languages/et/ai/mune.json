  "context": "The word 'mune' in Estonian is actually the partitive plural form of 'muna', which means 'egg'. So when used as 'mune', it refers to multiple eggs. The dictionary definitions show that the verb related to this concept is 'hauduma', meaning to incubate or hatch eggs, but also more broadly to plan or scheme."
