  "context": "The Estonian word 'l채heb' is the 3rd person singular present tense form of the verb 'minema' (to go). It can be used in various contexts: 1) To describe movement or travel - someone/something goes/is going somewhere, 2) To ask about how something or someone is doing (similar to English 'How's it going?'), 3) In questions asking what is happening with someone. The word changes form based on tense and subject."
