  "context": "The Estonian word 'meelde' is used to indicate remembrance or keeping something in mind. It appears as part of the verb phrase 'meeldejääma' (to remember) and can also be used with other verbs like 'meeldetuletama' (to remind). The form shown here seems to be in the illative case, indicating motion into a state of remembrance or being kept in mind."
