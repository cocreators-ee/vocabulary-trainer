  "context": "The Estonian word 'meelde' is the illative singular form of 'meel', which relates to memory. It's commonly used in the expression 'jätta meelde' meaning 'to make someone remember' or 'to keep something in mind'. This construction follows a specific pattern where 'meelde' acts as the destination object, similar to how English uses phrases like 'in your mind' when talking about remembering things."
