  "context": "The word 'pidasin' is an Estonian verb in past tense form, meaning 'I held', 'I considered', or 'I deemed'. It appears here with the compound adverbial phrase 'ainuõigeks', which means 'as the only correct/right' or 'as absolutely true'. The expression 'pidasin midagi ainuõigeks' translates to 'I considered something as being absolutely right/the only correct way'. This construction uses the elative case ('-ks') after 'ainuõige' to express the state of considering something to be in a certain condition."
