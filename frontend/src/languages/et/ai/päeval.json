  "context": "The word 'päeval' is an Estonian adessive case form of 'päev', which means 'day'. In adessive case, it indicates location or time 'on/at/with the day'. It's commonly used to specify that something happens during daylight hours rather than at night. The adessive case ending '-l' changes the noun to indicate being on or at the specified time."
