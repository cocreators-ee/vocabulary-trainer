  "context": "The word 'vittu' is a vulgar Estonian swear word that functions as an interjection similar to English 'fuck'. It's used to express frustration, anger, or emphasis. The word is considered quite vulgar and offensive in formal contexts, though somewhat less so than the English equivalent 'fuck'. In addition to its primary use as an exclamation, it can also appear as part of curse phrases."
