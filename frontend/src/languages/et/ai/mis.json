  "context": "The Estonian word 'mis' is an interrogative pronoun that means 'what' or 'which'. It's used to ask questions about information or identification. In its basic form 'mis', it can function as the subject of a question asking for information, similar to English 'what'. It doesn't change form for gender but may change in different grammatical contexts (though Estonian has relatively simple pronoun declension)."
