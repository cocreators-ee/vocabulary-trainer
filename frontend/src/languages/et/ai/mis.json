  "context": "The Estonian word 'mis' is primarily an interrogative pronoun meaning 'what' or 'which', used to ask questions about unknown information. It can also function as an adverb expressing degree (when, how much) and as an interjection showing surprise. As a pronoun, it follows irregular declension patterns with forms like 'mille' (genitive), 'mida' (partitive), and 'millesse' (illative)."
