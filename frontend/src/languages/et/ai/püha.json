  "context": "The Estonian word 'püha' has two main meanings. As an adjective, it means 'holy' or 'sacred', referring to things connected with God that deserve reverence and respect, such as holy places (püha maa), sacred objects (püha raamat), or sacred people (pühad isad). As a noun, it means 'holiday' - a day of religious or national importance when work is not done, like Christmas (jõulupüha) or Easter (ülestõusmispüha). It can also be used in exclamations to express surprise or shock, similar to saying 'Oh my God!'"
