  "context": "In Estonian, 'mere' is a noun that means 'sea' or 'ocean'. It's the main body of salt water that covers most of the Earth's surface. In Estonian grammar, it would typically be in either the nominative case as shown here or could appear in other cases depending on how it's used in a sentence (like 'meres', 'merega', etc.)."
