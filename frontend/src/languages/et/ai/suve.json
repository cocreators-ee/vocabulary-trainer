  "context": "The word 'suve' is the genitive singular and partitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'suvi', which means 'summer'. In the genitive case, it would be used to indicate possession or relationship to summer (e.g., 'of summer'), while in the partitive case, it indicates a portion or partial aspect of summer. The dictionary definition also mentions July 25th as being related to mid-summer in Estonian folk calendar tradition."
