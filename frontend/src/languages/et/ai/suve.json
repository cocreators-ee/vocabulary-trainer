  "context": "The word 'suve' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'suvi', which means 'summer'. In this genitive case, it typically indicates possession or relationship to summer. For example, in phrases like 'ilus suvep채ev' (beautiful summer day), the genitive form connects the adjective to the season. The nominative singular form would be 'suvi'."
