  "context": "\"Värvi\" is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun \"värv\". It can refer to: 1) The color or hue of something (eyes, flowers, etc.), 2) Paint used for coloring surfaces, or 3) The tone quality of a sound or voice. As the genitive case, it typically appears in contexts where possession or association is indicated, such as 'of color' or 'in terms of color'. In the sentences provided, it's used to ask about eye colors ('Mis värvi silmad tal on?' - What color are her eyes?), describe something by its color ('Koolivorm oli värvilt pruun.' - The school uniform was brown in color), and mention colors as a general concept ('Silmade, õite värv.' - The color of eyes, flowers)."
