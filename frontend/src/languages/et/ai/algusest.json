  "context": "The Estonian word 'algusest' is an adessive case form of the noun 'algus', meaning 'beginning'. The '-st' ending indicates it's in the adessive case, which typically means 'from' or 'off of' something. So 'algusest' specifically means 'from the beginning' or 'from the start'. This is commonly used to indicate where something originates from temporally."
