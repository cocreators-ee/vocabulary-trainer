  "context": "The Estonian word 'algusest' is an adessive case form of the word 'algus', which means 'beginning' or 'start'. It indicates starting point, origin, or beginning. The '-st' ending transforms it into the adessive case, meaning 'from something'. So 'algusest' specifically means 'from the beginning' and is commonly used to indicate that an action starts from the very beginning rather than continuing from some intermediate point."
