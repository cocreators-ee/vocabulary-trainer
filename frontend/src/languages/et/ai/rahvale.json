  "context": "The word 'rahvale' is an Estonian adessive case form of the noun 'rahvas' (people). The adessive case typically indicates location 'at' or 'on', but can also indicate purpose, beneficiary, or target. In this context, it functions as a dative equivalent showing that something is done for or to benefit people. It's commonly used in contexts where services are provided, events are organized, or information is given specifically for the benefit of ordinary citizens."
