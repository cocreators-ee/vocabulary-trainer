  "context": "The word 'kaetud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'katta', which means 'to cover'. It describes something that has been covered, coated, or wrapped in some way. In English, it can be translated as 'covered', 'coated', or 'covered up'. The word agrees with the subject it modifies and is used to describe the state of being covered."
