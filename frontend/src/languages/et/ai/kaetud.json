  "context": "The word 'kaetud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'katta', meaning 'to cover'. It describes something that has been covered or coated with another substance. The dictionary definition provided suggests it can refer to being 'adrut' (covered with a fine powder or film), which would make sense in contexts describing surfaces coated with dust, sand, or other fine materials."
