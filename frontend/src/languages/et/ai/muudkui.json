  "context": "The Estonian word 'muudkui' is an adverb and conjunction with multiple meanings: 1) It can indicate constant or continuous action (meaning 'always', 'constantly', 'continuously'), as in 'Kogu aeg muudkui tülitsevad' (They keep causing trouble all the time). 2) It can be used to exclude other possibilities (meaning 'only', 'just', 'merely'), as in 'Ei kusagil maad, muudkui lai veeväli ümberringi' (There's nowhere land, only a wide expanse of water all around). 3) It can function as a restrictive adverb (meaning 'but', 'however') or as a concessive conjunction introducing clauses that partially negate the previous statement."
