  "context": "The Estonian word 'muudkui' is an adverb that means 'just', 'only', or 'merely'. It's used to indicate that something is done in a simple, uncomplicated way without additional complexity or elaboration. The word consists of 'muu' (other/another) and 'kui' (than/comparative), but as an adverb it functions similarly to English words like 'just', 'only', or merely'. It modifies verbs to show that the action is simple and straightforward."
