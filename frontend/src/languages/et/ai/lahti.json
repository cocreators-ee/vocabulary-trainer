  "context": "The Estonian word 'lahti' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'open' when referring to doors or containers, 'apart' or 'loose' for objects that are separated or detached, and 'off' for something being removed or released. It's also commonly used in the sense of getting rid of something or someone (as in 'temast ei saa lahti'). The word appears in various idiomatic expressions and can describe physical states, actions of opening, separating, or releasing things, as well as more abstract concepts like opportunities being open or relationships ending."
