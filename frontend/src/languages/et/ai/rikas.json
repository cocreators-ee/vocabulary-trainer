  "context": "The Estonian word 'rikas' is an adjective that means rich or wealthy. It describes someone who has a lot of money or possessions. In Estonian grammar, this would typically be in the nominative case when used as a predicate adjective (like 'I am rich'), and it can change form based on gender (masculine rikas vs feminine rikas naisterahvas) and number (singular rikas vs plural rikkad)."
