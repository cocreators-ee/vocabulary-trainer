  "context": "In Estonian, 'röövis' is the third person singular past tense form of the verb 'röövima', meaning to rob or deprive someone. In this context from the dictionary definition, it specifically refers to robbing someone of their peace of mind or tranquility ('hingerahu'). The word suggests a violent removal or taking away that leaves the victim without something valuable - in this case, inner peace and quiet."
