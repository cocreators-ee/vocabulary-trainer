  "context": "The Estonian word 'tormi' is the adessive case form of 'torm', meaning 'storm'. However, in this context it functions as an adverbial expression meaning 'in a storming/charging manner' or 'with a rush'. It's used to describe running or charging toward something with great force and speed. The word appears in contexts like soldiers rushing toward a city or fortress, people running toward bargains, or reporters charging at a celebrity. It conveys the idea of moving quickly and forcefully toward a target."
