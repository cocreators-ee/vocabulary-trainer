  "context": "The word 'tormi' is the genitive singular form of 'torm', which means 'storm' in English. In Estonian, the genitive case typically indicates possession or relationship (meaning 'of storm' or 'belonging to a storm'). This form would be used when modifying nouns that belong to or are associated with storms. For example, 'Tormi k체sis mult abi' means '[The] storm asked me for help' - here tormi modifies the verb 'k체sis' (asked)."
