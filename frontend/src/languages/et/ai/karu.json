  "context": "The word 'karu' is the Estonian noun for 'bear', referring to the large mammal. It's typically used in its nominative singular form when talking about a bear, but can appear in other cases depending on grammatical context - like 'karud' (nominative plural) for multiple bears or 'karu' appearing in different cases with appropriate endings when modified by prepositions or as objects in sentences."
