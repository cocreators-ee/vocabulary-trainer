  "context": "The word 'peaks' in Estonian is the 3rd person singular form of the modal verb 'pidama' (to have to/should). It expresses obligation, expectation, or what should happen. In the dictionary definition, it's shown as an adverb meaning 'then, so' but this appears to be a different usage. The primary meaning in modern Estonian is 'should' or 'ought to'."
