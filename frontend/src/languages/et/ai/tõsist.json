  "context": "The word 'tõsist' is an Estonian adverb that means seriously, gravely, severely, or earnestly. It's used to describe the manner in which something is done or how a situation is treated. The dictionary definition shows it can be associated with dramatizing things and attributing too serious character to events or phenomena. In everyday usage, 'tõsist' indicates that an action is being performed with seriousness or that a situation is being taken seriously."
