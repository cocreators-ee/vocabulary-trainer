  "context": "The word 'tõsist' is the adessive case form of the adjective 'tõsis', which means serious or earnest. In Estonian, this case is often used to express the manner or way in which something is done. So 'tõsist' literally means 'in a serious/earnest manner'. It's commonly used to emphasize that someone is being sincere, not joking, or that they need to take something seriously."
