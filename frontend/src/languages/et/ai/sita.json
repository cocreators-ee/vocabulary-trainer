  "context": "The Estonian word 'sita' is a colloquial and somewhat vulgar term used to describe something as being of very poor quality, unpleasant, or generally bad. It’s similar in usage to the English words ‘crap’, ‘shitty’, or ‘awful’. While it can be used to describe objects or situations, it can also be directed at people (though this is considered rude)."
