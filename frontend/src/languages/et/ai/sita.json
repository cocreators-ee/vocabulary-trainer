  "context": "The Estonian word 'sita' means big, large, or tall. It's an adjective used to describe size in various contexts. In the first example sentence, it describes a dog that has become big. The second sentence uses it to describe a cat as large. In the third sentence, the child is not sitting firmly/strongly (though this may be a different usage related to 'sida' - to sit firmly)."
