  "context": "The Estonian word 'kott' has two main meanings: 1) A bag or sack (similar to English 'bag'), and can refer to a military pocket. In colloquial usage, when plural, it can mean 'balls' or 'testicles'. 2) As shown in the dictionary definitions from EKSS, 'kott' also refers specifically to big clumsy boots or shoes that are worn out, damaged, or uncomfortable. The word appears to have different declension patterns depending on which meaning is being used."
