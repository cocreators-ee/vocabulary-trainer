  "context": "The Estonian word 'kangelane' is a noun meaning 'hero'. It refers to someone who shows great courage and nobility, typically in dangerous or difficult situations. The word can be used for both male heroes (singular) and when referring to multiple heroes (plural: kangelased). In Estonian grammar, this follows the regular pattern where masculine nouns add '-d' to form the plural."
