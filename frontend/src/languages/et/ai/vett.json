  "context": "The word 'vett' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'vesi', which means 'water'. In Estonian, nouns change their endings to indicate different grammatical cases. The partitive case ('-t' ending) is commonly used with certain verbs and in specific grammatical contexts, such as expressing indefinite quantity, answering questions about what something consists of, or when the action affects only part of an object."
