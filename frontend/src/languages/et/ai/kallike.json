It's the diminutive form of 'kallis' (dear/expensive), and it functions similarly to English terms like 'dear,' 'sweetheart,' or 'darling.' The '-ke' suffix is commonly used in Estonian to create affectionate or diminutive forms. This word would typically be used when addressing someone with affection, such as a romantic partner, child, or loved one."
