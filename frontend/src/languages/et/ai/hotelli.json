  "context": "The word 'hotelli' is the Estonian translation for the English word 'hotel'. It refers to a commercial establishment that provides lodging, usually for short-term stays. In Estonian grammar, this appears to be in the partitive case (ending -i), which typically indicates an object or destination being referred to. The basic form would be 'hotell'."
