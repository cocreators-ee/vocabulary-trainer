  "context": "The Estonian word 'võidame' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the verb 'võima', which means 'to win'. It specifically translates to English as 'we win', indicating that the subject (the group including the speaker) achieves victory in some competition, game, or struggle. The '-me' ending indicates it's 1st person plural (we/us), and the present tense shows this is happening currently or habitually."
