  "context": "The Estonian word 'kole' has multiple meanings depending on context. As an adjective, it means 'ugly'. As an adverb, it intensifies the quality of whatever it modifies, meaning 'very', 'extremely', 'terribly', or 'awfully'. When used as an intensifier with adjectives like 'suur' (big), 'külm' (cold), 'laisk' (lazy), it means they are extremely so."
