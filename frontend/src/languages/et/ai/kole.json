  "context": "In Estonian, 'kole' is an adjective used to describe something or someone as ugly, unattractive, or horrible. It's a negative descriptor typically applied to physical appearance but can also refer to unpleasant situations or behaviors. The word doesn't change form in these examples as it's already in its base form."
