  "context": "The word 'õiget' is the partitive case form of the Estonian adjective 'õige', meaning 'right' or 'correct'. In this form, it typically follows a verb (like 'tegema' - to do) and indicates that something was done correctly, properly, or appropriately. The partitive case here shows that we're talking about some aspect or instance of being correct/right rather than the entirety."
