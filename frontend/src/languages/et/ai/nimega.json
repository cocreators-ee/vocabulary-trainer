  "context": "The Estonian word 'nimega' is a postposition that means 'with the name of' or 'named/called'. It's formed from 'nimi' (name) with the adessive case ending '-ga', meaning it literally translates to 'with name' but functions as an English equivalent of 'named' or 'called'. This word is typically used after a proper noun to specify what something is named, similar to how we use 'titled' for books or simply 'named' when introducing someone's identity."
