  "context": "The Estonian word 'kallis' is a versatile adjective with multiple meanings. Primarily, it means 'expensive' or 'costly' when referring to prices (e.g., expensive equipment). It can also mean 'precious' or 'valuable' when describing something important or cherished (e.g., health is the most precious possession). As an affectionate term, it functions as 'darling' or 'dear' when addressing loved ones. The word changes form depending on case, number, and grammatical function - with forms like kallid (plural nominative), kallist (partitive singular), and kalli (genitive singular)."
