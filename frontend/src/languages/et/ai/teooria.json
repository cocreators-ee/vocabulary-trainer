  "context": "Teeoria is an Estonian noun meaning 'theory' in English. It refers to a comprehensive system of scientific concepts, propositions, thought experiments, and proofs that describes some domain of reality. The word can also mean explanation, opinion, or hypothesis. It's derived from Ancient Greek θεωρία (theōría). In Estonian grammar, it follows the ÕS type 1/ohutu declension pattern with partitive form 'teooriat' in singular and 'teooriaid' in plural."
