  "context": "In Estonian, 'kaval' is an adjective that describes someone or something as cunning, sly, clever, deceitful, or treacherous. It can be used for people who are crafty and able to manipulate situations to their advantage (like a 'cunning fox'), but also for things that have deceptive or unexpected properties (like 'a cunningly narrow box'). The comparative form is 'kavalam' (more cunning) and the superlative is 'kõige kavalam' (most cunning)."
