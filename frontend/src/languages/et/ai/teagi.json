  "context": "The word 'teagi' is used as an intensifier or emphatic particle in Estonian. In the context of the sentence 'Konutate siin üksikul saarel ega teagi, mis maailmas sünnib!', 'teagi' adds emphasis to the idea that not only are they loafing around on a single island, but they don't even know what's happening in the world. It functions similarly to saying 'at all' or 'even' in English, amplifying the negation and lack of awareness."
