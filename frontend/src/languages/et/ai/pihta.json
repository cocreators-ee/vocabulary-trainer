  "context": "The Estonian word 'pihta' is a postposition and adverb with multiple related meanings. As a postposition (with genitive case), it indicates contact or direction: 'against', 'onto', or 'toward' something (e.g., koputab ukse pihta - knocks against the door). It also shows direction toward a target for hitting/shooting ('vaenlase pihta avati tiri' - fire was opened at the enemy). As an adverb, it signifies successful hitting or scoring ('sain palliga pihta' - I hit the ball / got hit by the ball). In colloquial usage with elative case, it can mean 'since' or 'from a certain time onwards'. The word appears in compound expressions like kirumisvormelites (curses) and various idiomatic phrases."
