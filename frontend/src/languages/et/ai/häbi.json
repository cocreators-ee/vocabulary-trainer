  "context": "The Estonian word 'häbi' primarily means shame - the feeling of humiliation, embarrassment, or guilt resulting from inappropriate behavior, disgraceful actions, or a degrading situation. It can refer to both internal feelings (like remorse and discomfort) and external circumstances that bring dishonor (disgraceful situations). The word is commonly used in expressions about experiencing strong deep shame, feeling ashamed to look or speak, or lacking any sense of shame at all."
