  "context": "In Estonian, 'vastas' is primarily used as a postposition (placed after the noun) meaning 'across from', 'opposite to', or 'facing'. It indicates spatial relationship where one object is positioned directly facing another. As an adverb, it means 'directly in front' or 'facing forward'. The word can also indicate opposition or being against something (in position or opinion)."
