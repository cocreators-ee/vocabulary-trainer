  "context": "\"Minnes\" is the Estonian elative case form of \"mine\" (to go). It functions as an adverbial participle meaning \"while going\", \"when going\", or \"as one goes\". The elative case indicates movement from within a place, and in this construction, it creates temporal clauses showing simultaneous actions - something happens while the subject is in the process of going somewhere."
