  "context": "The word 'sekundi' can have multiple meanings depending on context. In general usage, it refers to the unit of time - one second (in genitive/possessive case). However, in music theory terminology, it specifically denotes a musical interval or note that is a second higher or lower than the base note in melodic figuration, and also refers to notes that don't belong to the chord (non-chordal notes). The form 'sekundi' appears to be in genitive case, indicating possession or relation to seconds."
