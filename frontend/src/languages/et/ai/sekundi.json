  "context": "\"Sekundi\" is the partitive form of the Estonian word \"sekund\", which means \"second\" as in time. The partitive case is used here to indicate a duration or amount - literally meaning \"a second's worth of time\" or \"for a second\". It's commonly used when referring to short durations, such as waiting for a moment or timing something briefly."
