  "context": "The Estonian word 'tööga' is a translative form of the noun 'töö' (work). The '-ga' suffix indicates an instrumental case, meaning 'with', 'by means of', or 'using'. So 'tööga' specifically means 'with work', 'regarding work', or 'concerning work'. It's used to indicate that something is done using work as a tool or instrument, or refers to work in some capacity. This form often appears when talking about issues related to work, arriving with work, or handling matters of work."
