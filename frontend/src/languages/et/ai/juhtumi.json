  "context": "In Estonian, 'juhtumi' is the partitive case form of the noun 'juhtum'. It typically refers to a specific instance or occurrence of something - like a legal case, medical case, situation, or incident. The word 'juhtum' comes from the verb 'juhtuma' (to happen/to occur), so it literally means something that has happened or taken place. In the partitive case 'juhtumi', it often appears in contexts where we're talking about a specific instance of something, such as investigating a particular case, handling a situation, or referring to an incident."
