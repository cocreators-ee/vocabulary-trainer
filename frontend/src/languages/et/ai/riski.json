  "context": "The word 'riski' in this context is the partitive form of 'risk' (risk), but it appears to be used incorrectly or as a component within the larger definition provided. The dictionary entry shows that 'ettevõtja' means entrepreneur/business owner, and this person carries the risk ('riski') associated with their business activities. However, when looking at the word in isolation 'riski', it would typically mean 'a risk' (partitive case), not 'entrepreneur'. It seems there may be confusion between the headword 'ettevõtja' and a component word within its definition."
