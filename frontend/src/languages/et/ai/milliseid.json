  "context": "The word 'milliseid' is the partitive plural form of the interrogative pronoun 'mis' (what/which) in Estonian. It's used to ask about multiple items of a certain type, and indicates that we're looking for information about specific characteristics or types among multiple options. The '-d' ending shows it's in plural number, while the partitive case '-seid' indicates an incomplete or indefinite reference - asking about 'what kind of ones' rather than specifying particular items."
