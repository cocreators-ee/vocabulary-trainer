  "context": "The Estonian word 'haigla' means a hospital or medical facility where sick people are examined and treated. It's derived from the root word 'haige' meaning 'sick, ill' with the suffix '-la'. The word follows standard Estonian declension patterns, changing form depending on grammatical case. For example, 'haiglasse' (illative) means 'to hospital', while 'haiglast' (elative) means 'from hospital'. Various compound forms exist for different types of hospitals like 'keskhaigla' (central hospital), 'lastehaigla' (children's hospital), and 'sõjaväehaigla' (military hospital)."
