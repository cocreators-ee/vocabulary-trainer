  "context": "The Estonian verb 'mängima' has multiple meanings including: 1) to play games or sports (e.g., mängima palli - to play ball), 2) to perform music on an instrument, 3) to act in a play or movie, 4) to take on roles or pretend (e.g., mängida armastustega - to play with emotions), 5) to move or change position dynamically (e.g., pilgud mängivad - eyes move/play). It's an irregular verb that changes form based on context and can refer to both physical activities like sports and metaphorical concepts like playing with someone's feelings."
