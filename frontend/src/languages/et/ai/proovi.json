  "context": "The Estonian word 'proovi' is the imperative form of the verb 'proovima', which means 'to try' or 'to attempt'. It's used when giving a command or suggestion to someone else to try something. In different contexts, it can be translated as 'try' (when suggesting an action), 'attempt' (for making an effort at something difficult), or 'test' (when trying out something new). The word comes from the verb root 'proov-' which relates to testing or experiencing."
