  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'täpselt' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean exactly or precisely when referring to accuracy, on time for punctuality, or just/right when emphasizing correctness. It derives from the adjective 'täpne' (precise) with the adverbial suffix '-lt'. In its emphatic form, it's used to stress that something is absolutely correct or matches perfectly."
