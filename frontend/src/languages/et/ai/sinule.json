  "context": "The word 'sinulik' is an adjective derived from 'sina' (you), with the suffix '-lik' which means 'having the quality of'. It describes something that is characteristic or typical of a particular person, specifically related to 'you' in this case. The dictionary definition shows it can be used positively or negatively depending on context, as seen in the example sentence where someone leaving behind jewelry when planning to escape is described as not being 'sinulik' (not characteristic/typical of them)."
