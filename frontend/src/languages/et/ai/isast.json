  "context": "The Estonian word 'isast' is the elative case form of 'isa', which means 'father'. In Estonian grammar, the elative case typically indicates movement from or separation from a place, possession, or source. When used with 'isast', it can mean 'from father', 'of/from the father', or in some contexts 'with father' depending on the preposition that might be implied. This form is often used to indicate where something comes from or originates from the father."
