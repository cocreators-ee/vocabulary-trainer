  "context": "The Estonian word 'lootus' means hope or wish. It refers to an expectation that something desired will happen, or the feeling of wanting something to be true. The word can be used in various contexts such as hopes for the future (parema tuleviku lootus), hope for improvement (paranemislootus), or hope in general (loomulik lootus). It's derived from 'lootma' meaning to expect/hope and takes various case endings depending on its grammatical function in a sentence."
