  "context": "The Estonian word 'ka' is a versatile adverb that functions as an intensifier and connector. Its primary meanings include 'also', 'too', 'as well', and 'in addition'. It can appear in different positions within sentences to emphasize or connect ideas. When stressed, it strengthens the following word or phrase. In concessive clauses, it appears with relative pronouns meaning 'even if' or 'even though'. In speech, it can express vague affirmation or hesitation. The dictionary shows it's often replaceable with the suffixes '-gi' or '-ki', which have similar meanings of 'also/too'."
