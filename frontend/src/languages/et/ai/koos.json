  "context": "The Estonian word 'koos' is an adverb that means 'together'. It's used to indicate that people or things are in the company of each other, acting jointly, or sharing something. In grammar, it typically appears before verbs or after certain cases. For example, when saying 'we go together', you would say 'me koos lähme' where 'koos' modifies the verb 'lähme' (we go)."
