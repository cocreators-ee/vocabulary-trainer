  "context": "The word 'nägime' is the past tense first person plural form of the Estonian verb 'näha', which means 'to see'. It translates to English as 'we saw'. In the example sentence, it's used in the context of seeing something during a car ride - specifically mentioning that they only saw through the car window ('autoaknast'). The word comes from the root 'nä-' (to see) and adds the past tense suffix '-me' for first person plural. Other forms include nägin (I saw), said (you saw), nägid (he/she/it saw), nägime (we saw), näite (y'all saw), nägid (they saw)."
