  "context": "The word 'proovime' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'proovima', which means 'to try' or 'to attempt'. It corresponds to English 'we try' or 'let's try'. This form indicates that the speaker(s) are attempting something in the present moment. The word comes from a dictionary entry where it appears in an example sentence: \"Ma ei tea, kas mul üldse enam häält on,\" ütles Liina, \"aga proovime, vanasti ju natuke ikka laulsin..\" (Liina said: 'I don't know if I even have a voice anymore, but let's try, after all I used to sing a bit in the old days...')."
