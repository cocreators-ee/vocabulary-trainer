  "context": "The word 'kingi' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'king', which means 'pair of shoes'. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is used to indicate an unspecified quantity or partial whole. So 'kingi' refers to some pairs of shoes or shoes in general. This form is commonly used when talking about purchasing, needing, or referring to shoes without specifying a particular number."
