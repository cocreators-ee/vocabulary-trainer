  "context": "The Estonian word 'eelmine' is an adjective that means something that occurred before the current moment in time. It refers to what came earlier or what existed prior to the present situation. The word changes form depending on its grammatical function - it has different endings for cases (nominative, genitive, partitive) and numbers (singular/plural). For example, 'eelmise' is the genitive singular form used with prepositions like 'varem enne' or in constructions showing time relationships."
