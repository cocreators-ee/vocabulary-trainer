  "context": "The Estonian phrase 'omast' is used as an adverbial expression meaning 'in a certain/peculiar way' or 'to some extent'. It often appears in the full form 'omast kohast' which literally translates to 'from its own place/manner'. This construction emphasizes that something has a particular quality, manner, or degree that is characteristic of itself. The phrase suggests that there's something inherently distinctive about how something happens or exists."
