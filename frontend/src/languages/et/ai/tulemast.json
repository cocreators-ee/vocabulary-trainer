  "context": "The word 'tulemast' is an imperative form of the verb 'tulla' (to come) used as a polite invitation or welcome. It's commonly used when greeting guests and inviting them to enter a place, particularly in hospitality contexts like restaurants or homes. The '-mast' suffix indicates it's in the elative case, often used for directional movement out of something, but here functioning as an imperative command."
