  "context": "The word 'tulemast' is the elative form of the Estonian verb 'tulema', which means 'to come'. It's commonly used as a polite invitation to enter or welcome someone. The '-mast' ending indicates movement from somewhere, so it literally means 'come (from) here/there'. In everyday usage, it's equivalent to saying 'please come in' or 'welcome' when inviting people into a space."
