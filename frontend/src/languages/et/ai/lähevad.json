  "context": "The word 'lähevad' in Estonian is a verb form that means 'go' or 'are going'. In this context from the dictionary, it appears to be part of an expression related to listening intently. The full phrase seems to involve kõrvu (ears) and kikki (a colloquial term for prick up or listen attentively). So when combined with other parts, the expression describes someone becoming very attentive in their listening, as if pricking up their ears."
