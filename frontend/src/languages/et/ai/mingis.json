  "context": "The word 'mingis' appears to be a case form of the Estonian word 'mink', specifically the inessive singular form. However, it's also listed as having definitions related to an 'adjunkt' position, particularly referring to junior teaching staff at higher education institutions or officers preparing for scientific work in military educational establishments. The most likely meaning is either 'in some position' (as a case form of 'mink') or it could be related to the academic position of adjunct/assistant professor."
