  "context": "The phrase 'käsi mängus' literally translates to 'hand in play/game'. It means that someone is involved or participating in something, particularly when referring to questionable activities, schemes, or situations where there's some degree of involvement, often implying complicity or participation in events (possibly negative ones). The word 'mängus' here is part of the fixed expression and doesn't mean 'game' on its own but rather indicates active participation or involvement."
