  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'tavaline' means normal, usual, common, ordinary or regular. It can describe something that is typical, standard, or happens frequently. The word declines regularly in Estonian with forms like tavalise (genitive), tavalist (partitive), and tavalisem (comparative). It's commonly used to indicate something is not unusual or exceptional but rather conforms to what is expected or common."
