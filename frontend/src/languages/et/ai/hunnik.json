  "context": "The Estonian word 'hunnik' primarily refers to a pile or heap of things stacked together, either neatly or haphazardly. It can describe accumulations of various materials like leaves, sand, books, records, etc. The term is commonly used for both organized piles (like a stack of books) and random collections (like a pile of fallen leaves). It's often used with specific modifiers to indicate what kind of pile it is (e.g., 'liivahunnik' - sand pile, 'puuhunnik' - wood pile)."
