  "context": "The Estonian word 'lapsega' is formed from 'laps' (child) and the instrumental case suffix '-ga', meaning 'with a child'. However, in certain contexts it can also mean 'pregnant' or 'expecting a child', similar to how English speakers might say 'she's with child'. The word shows possession or accompaniment when used literally, but has an idiomatic pregnancy meaning as well."
