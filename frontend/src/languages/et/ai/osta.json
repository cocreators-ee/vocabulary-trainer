  "context": "The word 'osta' is a verb in Estonian that means 'to buy' or 'purchase'. It appears to be the present indicative connegative form and second-person singular imperative of the verb 'ostma'. In Estonian grammar, the connegative form is used with negative verbs like 'ei' (not), while the imperative form is used for commands. So 'osta' can mean both '(I/he/she/it) buy(s)' in negative contexts ('ei osta' - doesn't buy) and as a command 'buy!' or 'you buy!'."
