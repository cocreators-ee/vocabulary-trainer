  "context": "The word 'õigust' in Estonian is the partitive form of 'õigus', meaning 'right'. In this context, it appears to be related to 'abonement' (subscription), where it would mean 'the right granted by a subscription'. A subscription or season ticket gives someone the right to attend events during a specific period. This could refer to theater performances, concerts, lectures, or other events that are available through a prepaid series of tickets."
