  "context": "The word 'armastad' is the 2nd person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'armastama', which means 'to love'. It is used when addressing one person informally (using 'te' for formal) and translates to 'you love' in English. The verb follows Estonian conjugation patterns where the ending changes based on person and number."
