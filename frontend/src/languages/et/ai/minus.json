  "context": "In Estonian, 'minus' is a colloquial or informal term meaning 'my child' or 'my kid'. It's often used in speech when referring to one's own child, similar to how English speakers might say 'mine' when talking about their children. The word can be used for both sons and daughters regardless of gender."
