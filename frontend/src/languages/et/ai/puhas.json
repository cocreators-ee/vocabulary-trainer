  "context": "The Estonian word 'puhas' is an adjective that means 'clean', 'pure', or 'clear'. It can describe objects, environments, or substances that are free from dirt, contamination, or impurities. The word changes form depending on the case and number of the noun it modifies - for example, it becomes 'puhast' in the translative singular case as seen in the third sentence where it means 'clean' (in instrumental/comitative function)."
