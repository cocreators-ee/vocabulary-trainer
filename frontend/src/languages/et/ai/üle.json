  "context": "The Estonian word 'üle' is a versatile preposition, postposition, and adverb with multiple meanings. As a preposition, it governs the genitive case and indicates movement over or above something (e.g., jumping over a fence). It can also mean 'throughout' when referring to distribution across an area (e.g., known throughout the land). As a postposition governing the elative case, it means 'over' in the sense of crossing from one side to another. As an adverb, it means 'remaining,' 'leftover,' or 'too much.' The word has cognates with Finnish 'yli' and is used in numerous compound verbs and expressions."
