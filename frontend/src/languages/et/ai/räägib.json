  "context": "The word 'räägib' is the third-person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'rääkima', which means 'to talk' or 'to speak'. It's used when referring to what someone (he/she/it) is saying or talking about at the present moment. In Estonian, verbs change their endings depending on the subject and tense, so 'räägib' specifically indicates that a single person (not plural) is currently engaged in conversation."
