  "context": "The word 'metsa' appears to be the genitive, partitive, or illative singular form of the Estonian noun 'mets'. It's commonly used as a grammatical case marker rather than having its own independent meaning. In the example sentences, it's used with 'poole' (toward) in the expression 'metsa poole', which means 'toward the forest' or 'in the direction of the forest'. The word can also metaphorically mean being slightly confused or not entirely clear-headed ('nupust nikastanud, napakas, mitte päris täie aruga')."
