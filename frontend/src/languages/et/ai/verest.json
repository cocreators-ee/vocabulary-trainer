  "context": "The word 'verest' is the elative case of 'vere', which means 'from blood' or 'out of blood'. It indicates origin or source from blood. In Estonian, the elative case shows where something comes out or originates from. So 'verest' specifically means 'from the blood' and would be used in contexts indicating that something is derived from blood, taken out of blood, or originating from blood."
