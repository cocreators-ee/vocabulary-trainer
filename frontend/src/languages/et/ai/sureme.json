  "context": "The word 'sureme' is a 1st person plural form of the Estonian verb 'surnud' (to die), meaning 'we die' or 'we are dying'. It appears to be used in a poetic or literary context, possibly as an archaic or dialectal form. In the provided example from H. Raudsepp's work, it seems to express the idea of death or fading away together with the sun."
