  "context": "The word 'sureme' appears to be a colloquial or dialectal Estonian expression meaning 'hurry up' or 'do something quickly'. It functions as an imperative verb form, telling someone to act swiftly. This seems to be derived from the root 'sure-' which relates to speed, with '-me' being a suffix that forms an imperative command."
