  "context": "In Estonian, 'meister' is a noun that refers to a master or expert in a particular field. It can be used for someone who has reached the highest level of skill in their profession or craft, similar to how it's used in English but with strong connotations of expertise and mastery rather than just being an ordinary professional."
