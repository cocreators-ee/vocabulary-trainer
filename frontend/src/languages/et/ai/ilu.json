  "context": "In Estonian, 'ilu' is a versatile word with multiple meanings. It primarily means beauty or splendor - referring to aesthetically pleasing qualities in people, nature, art, etc. As a suffix '-iluks', it can mean 'for decoration' or 'as an ornament'. In older usage and some contexts, it can also mean joy, delight, or happiness (similar to the Finnish cognate ilo). The word is used both for external beauty and internal qualities, as well as decorative elements."
