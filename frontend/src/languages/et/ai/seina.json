  "context": "The word 'seina' is part of the Estonian case system. It appears to be in the illative case (ending -a), which indicates movement toward or direction to a place. The base form would likely be 'sein' (wall). So 'seina' means something like 'toward the wall', 'to the wall', or 'in the wall'. In example sentences, it shows location/direction relative to a wall."
