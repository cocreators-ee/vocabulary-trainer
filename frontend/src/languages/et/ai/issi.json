  "context": "'Issi' is an affectionate term for 'father' in Estonian. It's commonly used by young children to refer to their father in a familiar and loving way. The word appears to be derived from the standard Estonian word 'isa' (father) but with a diminutive or childlike ending '-si', making it sound more tender and informal, similar to how English-speaking children might say 'daddy' instead of 'father'."
