  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'korralik' has multiple related meanings. It can mean 'proper' or 'correct' when referring to things that are done right, 'decent' when describing quality or amount, and 'orderly' or 'tidy' for well-organized things. When applied to people, it means they're reliable, responsible, and follow proper conduct. The word comes from 'kord' (order/regularity) + '-lik' (adjective suffix), so its core meaning relates to orderliness and propriety."
