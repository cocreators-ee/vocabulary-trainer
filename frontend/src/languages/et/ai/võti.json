  "context": "The Estonian word 'võti' has multiple meanings. Primarily, it refers to a physical key used for opening and closing locks (like house keys or safe keys). Figuratively, it can mean something that provides access to understanding or solving problems - like the 'key' to success or knowledge. In music theory, 'võti' specifically means a clef (the symbol at the beginning of musical notation that determines note positions). It's also used for tools like wrenches or screwdrivers, and in certain contexts can refer to nature, character, or style when used with specific case endings."
