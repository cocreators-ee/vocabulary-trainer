  "context": "The Estonian word 'relva' is the partitive singular form of 'relv', which means 'weapon' or 'firearm'. It appears to be used in contexts where someone is showing skill in handling a weapon, particularly from horseback as suggested by the first definition. The word refers to individual weapons rather than arms in general."
