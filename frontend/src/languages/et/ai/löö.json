  "context": "The Estonian word 'aga' is a versatile conjunction and adverb that serves multiple purposes in communication. As a conjunction, it introduces contrast between clauses ('but', 'however'), as in 'Eile oli külm, aga täna on soe' (Yesterday was cold, but today is warm). It can also be used to introduce clarifying or explanatory information. As an adverb, 'aga' functions as an intensifier meaning 'only', 'just', or 'merely'. Additionally, it appears in exclamations expressing surprise or emphasis, and can convey threats or objections when emphasized. The word often connects related ideas while highlighting differences between them."
