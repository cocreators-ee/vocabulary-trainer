  "context": "The word 'kunsti' appears to be an Estonian word related to art. In the provided examples, it seems to function in contexts where 'art' would be used in English. However, 'kunsti' specifically appears to be in a possessive or partitive form rather than the nominative case. The base word 'kunst' means 'art', and '-i' is likely an ending indicating possession (like English \"of art\" or \"in art\")."
