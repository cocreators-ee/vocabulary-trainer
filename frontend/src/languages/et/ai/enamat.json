  "context": "The word 'enamat' is the partitive case form of 'enam', which means 'more'. In Estonian, the partitive case often indicates an incomplete action or the object of an action. So 'enamat' can be translated as 'more' but with a nuance that it's some additional amount beyond what was already mentioned or expected."
