  "context": "The word 'ajaloos' is the inessive case form of the Estonian noun 'ajalugu', which means 'history'. The '-s' ending indicates location within or on something, so 'ajaloos' literally means 'in history' and is used to indicate that something exists, occurs, or is discussed within the context of historical events."
