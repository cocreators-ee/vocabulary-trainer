  "context": "The word 'inimestega' is the Estonian instrumental case form of 'inimene' (person), meaning 'with people' or 'via people'. It indicates that something was done using people as a means, intermediary, or instrument. For example, information might be obtained through someone (someone's help) or distributed among people. The suffix '-ga' transforms the genitive plural form into the instrumental case."
