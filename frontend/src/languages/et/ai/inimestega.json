  "context": "The word 'inimestega' is the Estonian instrumental case form of 'inimesed' (people), meaning it indicates accompaniment or instrumentality - essentially showing that something is done 'with people'. The '-ga' suffix at the end transforms the nominative plural 'inimesed' into the instrumental plural form, indicating the action involves other people as instruments or companions."
