  "context": "The Estonian word 'mängida' is a versatile verb that primarily means 'to play'. It can be used in various contexts: playing games or sports (e.g., palli mängima - to play ball), playing musical instruments (e.g., klaverit mängima - to play the piano), acting or performing (in theater or films), and even figuratively meaning to treat someone/playfully interact with them. It's one of the most common and flexible verbs in Estonian, similar to English 'play' but with even broader application."
