  "context": "The Estonian word 'naabrid' is the plural form of 'naaber', meaning 'neighbor'. It refers to people who live next door or near you. In English, this translates to 'neighbors' or 'next-door neighbors'. The word '-id' at the end indicates it's in plural form, so when referring to multiple neighbors, Estonians use 'naabrid'."
