  "context": "The Estonian word 'öeldes' is an adessive case form of the verb 'öelda' (to say/speak). It functions as a temporal or instrumental participle meaning 'while saying,' 'by saying,' or 'when speaking.' This construction is commonly used in Estonian to indicate that something was said while another action was taking place. It's formed by adding the '-es' suffix to the verb root and typically appears at the beginning of a clause to set temporal context."
