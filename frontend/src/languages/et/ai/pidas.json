  "context": "The Estonian verb 'pidas' is versatile and can mean 'to hold' physically, but more commonly it implies 'to consider' something important or to 'keep' something in mind. It also has a sense of obligation or duty – 'I have to'. The usage can be similar to the English 'to deem' or 'to regard'."
