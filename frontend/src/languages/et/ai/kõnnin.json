  "context": "The word 'kõnnin' appears to be a conjugated form of the verb 'kõndima' (to walk) in Estonian, meaning 'I walk'. However, based on the context provided in the dictionary definitions and example sentences, it's likely that the user is asking about the reflexive pronoun 'ise' which means 'oneself', 'myself', etc. The example sentence 'Kõnnin mööda teed ja ise mõtlen' translates to 'I walk along the road and think myself/think by myself'. Here, 'kõnnin' is clearly 'I walk' while 'ise' is used as an emphatic pronoun meaning 'by myself' or 'oneself'."
