  "context": "The word 'küsid' is the second-person singular form of the Estonian verb 'küsima', which means 'to ask'. It's used when addressing someone directly in an informal context. In the provided dictionary definition, it appears as part of a longer phrase where someone is being addressed rudely or angrily. The full phrase 'Küsid veel, kuradinahk!' translates to something like 'You still ask, you devil/satan!'. This shows that 'küsid' can be used in confrontational contexts when demanding answers from someone who is not cooperating."
