  "context": "The word 'võisin' is the past conditional form of the Estonian verb 'võima', which means 'to be able to' or 'can'. It expresses ability or possibility in the past. In the example sentence, it's used with 'hingest' (from the heart) to express that someone couldn't possibly have imagined or guessed something - essentially saying there was no way they could have known."
