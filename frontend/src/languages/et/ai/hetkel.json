  "context": "The Estonian word 'hetkel' means 'at the moment', 'currently', or 'right now'. It is an adverb that indicates the present time when something is happening. The word comes from 'hetk' (moment) and the suffix '-el', which in Estonian often indicates location or state. So literally it could be understood as 'in the moment' or 'at this moment'. This word is commonly used in everyday conversation to specify that what you're referring to is true at this particular time, though it may change later."
