  "context": "The word 'öelge' is the plural or formal imperative form of the Estonian verb 'öelda', which means 'to say' or 'to speak'. It's used when addressing multiple people formally, similar to 'say' in English but with a polite/respectful tone. The ending '-ge' indicates this is an instruction/command given to more than one person."
