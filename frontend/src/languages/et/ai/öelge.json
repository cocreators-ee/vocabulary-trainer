  "context": "The word 'öelge' is the imperative plural form of the verb 'öelda' (to say/speak). In this context, it appears in a quote where someone is encouraging others to speak out freely. The full sentence shows that 'julgustama' (to encourage) is what Indrek is doing by telling people to 'say everything beautifully'. So 'öelge' here is part of the encouragement - he's urging them to speak up without fear."
