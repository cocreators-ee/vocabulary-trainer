  "context": "The Estonian word 'venna' is the genitive case form of 'vend', which means 'brother'. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case typically indicates possession or relationship. So 'venna' would be used when saying 'of brother' or 'my brother's'. For example, in the sentence 'Minu venna nimi on Mart' (My brother's name is Mart), 'venna' shows possession of the name."
