  "context": "Maagia is the Estonian word for magic or sorcery. It refers to supernatural practices and arts that involve influencing people or things through mystical means, rituals, and spells. The term encompasses both 'must maagia' (black magic) used in medieval times to influence evil spirits and 'valge maagia' (white magic) used to influence good spirits. Maagia can also describe any very powerful, almost magical influence that something or someone has, such as 'arvude, salapäraste helide maagia' - the magic of numbers, mysterious sounds."
