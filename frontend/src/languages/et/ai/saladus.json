  "context": "The Estonian word 'saladus' has multiple related meanings. Primarily, it refers to a secret or confidentiality - something kept hidden or private from others. It can also mean a mystery or unknown aspect of something. In its extended sense, it may refer to special knowledge, techniques, or skills in a particular field (like cooking secrets). The word is formed from 'sala' (hidden/secret) and the suffix '-dus' which indicates state or quality."
