  "context": "The Estonian verb 'lendama' primarily means to fly or move through the air, used for birds, aircraft, and other objects moving in the air. It can also figuratively mean to move quickly or to pass rapidly (especially regarding time). The word comes from Proto-Finnic *lentädäk and is conjugated as a regular -ma verb."
