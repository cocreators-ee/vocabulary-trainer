  "context": "The word 'paremaks' is the comparative form of the Estonian adjective 'parem' meaning 'better'. In this context, it appears to be part of a phrase 'taga paremaks' which seems to mean something like 'to the back' or 'behind', possibly used as an instruction or direction in the example sentences. It's likely derived from the word 'taga' (back/behind) and the comparative form 'paremaks' suggesting movement to a better position at the rear."
