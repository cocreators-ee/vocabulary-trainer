  "context": "The Estonian word 'tüüp' can be translated to English as 'type', 'kind', or 'sort', and is often used to refer to a person, similar to the colloquial use of 'guy' or 'person' in English. It's a common noun that can be used both literally (to classify something) and informally (to refer to people)."
