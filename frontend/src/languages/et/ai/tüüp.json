  "context": "The Estonian word 'tüüp' has several related meanings. It primarily means 'type' or 'category', referring to groups with shared characteristics (e.g., personality types, object types). In colloquial usage, it's also used to refer to a person - either as 'guy' or 'bloke' informally, or to describe someone based on their character traits (e.g., 'he's not the marrying type'). It can also mean a literary or dramatic character archetype."
