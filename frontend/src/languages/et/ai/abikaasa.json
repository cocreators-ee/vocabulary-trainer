  "context": "The Estonian word 'abikaasa' is a noun meaning spouse, husband, or wife. It's formed from the compound of 'abi' (help) and 'kaasa' (companion), literally translating to 'helping companion.' The word doesn't distinguish gender by itself - it can refer to either a husband or wife without specifying gender. Estonian often uses this neutral term unless explicitly wanting to specify the spouse's gender."
