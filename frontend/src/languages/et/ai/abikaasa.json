  "context": "The word 'abikaasa' in Estonian refers to a spouse or marriage partner. It can be used for both husbands and wives, as Estonian does not have gender-specific terms for spouses like English does. The word comes from 'abi' (help) + 'kaasane' (companion), literally meaning 'helping companion'. In plural form it becomes 'abikaasad', referring to multiple spouses or married couples."
