  "context": "The Estonian word 'kade' means envious or jealous. It describes a feeling of resentment or longing when someone has something you desire. In the first example, it shows being envious of success. The second sentence demonstrates jealousy toward someone else's possessions (a new car). The third example uses 'kadetuse' (the genitive form meaning 'of envy') to describe the unpleasant nature of this feeling."
