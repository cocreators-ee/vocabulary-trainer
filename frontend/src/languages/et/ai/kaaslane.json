  "context": "The Estonian word 'kaaslane' refers to a companion or someone who accompanies you on a journey or in daily life. It can be used for both people and sometimes even pets that accompany their owners. The word comes from 'kaasa-' (together) and '-lane' (person), literally meaning 'a person with whom one goes together'. It's often used to describe travel companions, friends who spend a lot of time together, or someone who shares experiences with you."
