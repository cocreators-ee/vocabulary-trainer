  "context": "The Estonian word 'kaaslane' refers to a companion or fellow - someone who accompanies another person on a journey, activity, or in life. It can be used for both people and sometimes animals or even things that accompany one regularly. The word comes from 'kaasa' (with) + '-lane' (person/one who does), literally meaning 'one who is with'. It's commonly used to describe travel companions, work partners, life partners, or anyone who shares an experience with you."
