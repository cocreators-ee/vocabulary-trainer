  "context": "The Estonian word 'hingata' means to breathe or to take breaths. It refers to the physical action of breathing - inhaling air into the lungs and exhaling it out. This is the basic physiological process that keeps us alive, allowing oxygen to enter our bodies and carbon dioxide to be expelled. The word can be used in various contexts including describing someone's breathing pattern (deep, shallow, difficult), teaching children how to breathe, or referring to respiratory functions."
