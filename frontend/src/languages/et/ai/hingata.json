  "context": "The Estonian verb 'hingata' means to breathe or to take breath. It can refer to the physical act of breathing, as in inhaling and exhaling air. The word can also be used more specifically to mean sighing, which is a deeper or audible breath often expressing emotion. In different contexts, it might be used in medical discussions about respiration, in everyday conversation about breathing exercises, or poetically to describe the rhythm of life."
