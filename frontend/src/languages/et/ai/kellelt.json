  "context": "The Estonian word 'kellelt' is an interrogative pronoun in the elative case, meaning it asks about the origin or source of something. It's formed from the stem 'kel-' (who/whom) with the '-lt' suffix indicating movement away from a location or person. This form is specifically used when asking who someone/something came from, who gave something, or who provided information."
