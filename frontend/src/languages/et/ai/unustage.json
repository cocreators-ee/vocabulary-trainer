  "context": "The word 'unustage' is an Estonian verb that means 'don't forget' or 'forget'. It's the imperative form of the verb 'unustama' (to forget). In the given context, it appears in a phrase where someone is being told not to forget their mother tongue. This suggests it carries a sense of urging someone to remember something important rather than simply letting them fade from memory."
