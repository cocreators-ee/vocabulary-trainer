  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'koheselt' means immediately or right away. It indicates that something should be done without delay, at the very moment it is required. The word comes from 'kohe' meaning 'now' or 'immediately', with the '-selt' suffix forming an adverb. It's commonly used in contexts where prompt action is necessary or expected."
