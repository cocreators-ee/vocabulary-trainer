  "context": "The word 'tõde' is an Estonian noun meaning 'truth'. It is in the nominative singular form. The stem shows a clear connection to other related words like 'tões' (in truth) and 'tõest' (from truth). In Estonian grammar, this would decline through various cases: genitive tõde, partitive tõed, illative tõdesse etc."
