  "context": "The word 'viiakse' is the passive voice form of the Estonian verb 'viia', which means 'to take' or 'to carry'. In this case, it's in the 3rd person singular/plural present/future tense. The '-kse' suffix indicates the passive voice construction in Estonian. It describes an action being done to something or someone without specifying who is performing the action."
