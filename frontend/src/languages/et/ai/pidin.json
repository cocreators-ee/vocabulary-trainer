  "context": "The word 'pidin' appears to be a typo in the dictionary definition. Looking at context, it seems to be part of 'ma pidin ju talle helistama' (I really had to call her), where 'pidin' means 'had to' - the first person singular past tense of 'pidama' meaning 'must/should/have to'. This is likely an error in the dictionary entry where 'pidin' appears as part of the example sentence rather than being defined separately."
