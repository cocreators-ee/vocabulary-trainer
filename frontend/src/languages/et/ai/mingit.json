  "context": "The Estonian word 'mingit' is a partitive form of the indefinite pronoun 'midagi', which translates to 'anything,' 'something,' or 'any' in English. Itâ€™s used to indicate an unspecified quantity or amount, often implying uncertainty or lack of definition. In English, it's commonly used in negative sentences ('I don't know anything') or with verbs suggesting a limited scope ('Do you have any idea?')."
