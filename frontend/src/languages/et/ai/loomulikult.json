  "context": "The Estonian word 'loomulikult' is an adverb that means naturally or of course. It's derived from the adjective 'loomulik' (natural). This word is used to describe something that happens in a natural, expected way, or as a response indicating agreement or obviousness. For example, when someone asks if you plan to continue studying, responding 'Loomulikult!' means 'Of course!' It can also describe behavior that is simple and natural without pretense."
