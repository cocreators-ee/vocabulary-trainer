  "context": "The Estonian word 'loomulikult' is an adverb that means naturally, of course, or obviously. It's used to indicate something that is self-evident, to be expected, or follows logically from a situation. The word comes from the adjective 'loomulik' (natural) and the suffix '-ult' which forms adverbs in Estonian. It can express agreement with what was previously said, confirm an obvious fact, or introduce something that should be taken for granted."
