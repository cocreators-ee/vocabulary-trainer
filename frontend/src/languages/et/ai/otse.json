  "context": "The Estonian word 'otse' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings. It can mean 'straight' (as in direction), 'directly', 'frankly/openly' when speaking, and also 'just/right/exactly'. From the dictionary definitions, we see it has four main uses: 1) describing straight lines or direct paths without deviation; 2) meaning openly, frankly, or directly in communication; 3) indicating immediacy or being right at a location; and 4) emphasizing something as genuine, real, or downright. It's an old instructive case form of 'ots' (end/endpoint/tip)."
