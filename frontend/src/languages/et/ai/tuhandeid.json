  "context": "The word 'tuhandeid' is the partitive plural form of Estonian numeral 'tuhat' (thousand). It is used when referring to an indefinite, large quantity of things or people. The partitive case in Estonian indicates that we're talking about some portion or amount of something rather than a complete set. This form is commonly used with verbs like 'on' (is/are), 'elab' (lives), and other expressions involving quantities."
