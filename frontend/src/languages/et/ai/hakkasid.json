  "context": "The word 'hakkasid' is the past tense plural form of 'hakkama' (to begin/start) and combines with 'plaksuma' (to clap/clatter). It means 'you all started/began clapping' or 'they began to make a clattering sound'. The verb shows an action that just started in the past, with multiple subjects performing the action simultaneously."
