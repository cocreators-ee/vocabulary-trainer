  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaade' has several related meanings. It can refer to a physical look or glance at something, such as when describing someone's expression (e.g., 'sõbralik vaade' - friendly look). It can also mean a view or panorama from a high place, like a landscape vista (e.g., 'vaade mägedele' - view of the mountains). Additionally, it can refer to an artistic representation of a scene (painting, postcard), and metaphorically to someone's viewpoint, opinion, or perspective on matters (e.g., 'eluvaaed' - views on life). The word has multiple compound forms that specify these different meanings."
