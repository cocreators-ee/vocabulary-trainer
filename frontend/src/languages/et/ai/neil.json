  "context": "The Estonian word 'neil' is the adessive case form of either 'nad' (they) or 'need' (these/those). It functions as a pronoun meaning 'to/at/on them' and indicates location or direction toward someone. When used unstressed in a sentence, it appears as 'neil', but when stressed, the form 'nendel' is used instead."
