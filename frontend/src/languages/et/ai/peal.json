  "context": "The Estonian word 'peal' is primarily used as a postposition (similar to an English preposition) meaning 'on', 'on top of', 'upon', 'over', or 'above'. It's the adessive case form of 'pea' which means 'head'. In this grammatical function, it indicates location on the surface of something. The word can also appear in different forms like 'pealt' when used with certain cases (e.g., 'käigu pealt' meaning 'from upon the step/course')."
