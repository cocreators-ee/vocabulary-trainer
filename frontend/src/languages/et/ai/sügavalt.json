  "context": "Sügavalt is an Estonian adverb that has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'deeply' when referring to physical depth or intensity (e.g., deep breathing, deep love), 'very/extremely' for emphasis on quality or degree, and it's also used with certain verbs of emotion, thinking, or physical actions. The word comes from the ablative case of 'sügav' (deep) and functions as an intensifier in many contexts."
