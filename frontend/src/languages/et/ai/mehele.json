  "context": "The Estonian word 'mehele' is a directional case form of the noun 'mees' (man). It appears to be in the allative case, which indicates movement toward or direction toward someone/something. This suffix '-le' transforms the nominative form 'mees' into 'mehele', showing motion toward a man or destination being a man."
