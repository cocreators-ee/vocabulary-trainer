  "context": "The word 'mehele' in Estonian has multiple meanings depending on context. As an allative form of 'mees', it means 'to the man'. In dictionary definitions, it appears as part of verb constructions: 1) to sell or put up for sale (e.g., selling goods), 2) to waste or spend money/inheritance, and 3) to put into use or start using something. The word functions differently based on the verb it's paired with in a sentence."
