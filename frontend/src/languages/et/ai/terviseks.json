  "context": "Terviseks is an Estonian interjection used when making a toast, similar to 'Cheers!' in English. It literally means 'for/to health' as it's the translative case of 'tervis' (health). When Estonians raise their glasses together, they often say 'Tervisekse!' or simply 'Terviseks!' to wish good health and celebrate the moment."
