  "context": "The word 'vaenlase' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'vaenlane', which means 'enemy'. In Estonian, nouns have cases that show different grammatical relationships. The genitive case typically indicates possession or origin, but here it's used as the object form after certain verbs like 'võitlema' (to fight) or as part of a possessive construction. The root word 'vaenlane' refers to someone who is hostile or opposed to you - an enemy, foe, or adversary."
