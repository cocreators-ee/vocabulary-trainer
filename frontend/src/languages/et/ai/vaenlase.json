  "context": "The word 'vaenlase' in Estonian refers to an enemy's ship or vessel, particularly in a naval combat context. It is used when referring to the target of an attack during boarding operations where one ship attacks another by lashing to its side to allow crew members to board and engage in combat. The term comes from 'vaenlane' (enemy) with the genitive case ending '-se', indicating possession or belonging - literally meaning 'of the enemy' or 'the enemy's'. In historical naval terminology, this specifically referred to enemy warships during sailing ship eras."
