  "context": "The Estonian word 'musta' has multiple grammatical functions depending on context. It can be the partitive singular form of 'must' meaning 'black', indicating an indefinite amount or object in part case. It can also be the genitive singular form, possession of something black. Additionally, it serves as the illative singular form, expressing movement into or towards something black. In the provided example sentence 'Tuleb külla musta krunti noormees,' 'musta' modifies 'krunti' (crude term) and is likely in genitive case indicating possession by the young man."
