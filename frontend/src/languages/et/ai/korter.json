  "context": "In Estonian, 'korter' refers to an apartment or flat - a living space consisting of one or more rooms along with additional spaces like kitchen and hallway. It's the most common term for residential units in multi-story buildings, contrasting with single-family houses (maja). The word can also refer to temporary lodging places, but primarily denotes permanent housing arrangements."
