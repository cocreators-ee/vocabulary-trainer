  "context": "The word 'sellises' is an Estonian inessive case form of 'selline', which means 'such' or 'this'. In this context, it refers to a specific manner or style of speaking - specifically described as patetic (pateetiline), empty (tühi), and ringing/knocking (kõminev) oratory. It's used to describe overly ornate, exaggerated speech that lacks substance. The word appears in the dictionary definition explaining 'ilu|kõne' (beauty|speech), which refers to a high-flying, inflated style of expression."
