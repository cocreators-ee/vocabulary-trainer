  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõige' is used as an intensifier to form the superlative degree of adjectives and adverbs. It can be translated as 'the most' in English or function similarly to the '-est' suffix. It's also sometimes used as an adverb meaning 'very'. When modifying adjectives, it creates superlatives like 'ilus' (beautiful) becoming 'kõige ilusam' (the most beautiful)."
