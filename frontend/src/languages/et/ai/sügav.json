  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'sügav' has multiple meanings depending on context. It primarily means 'deep' in a physical sense (referring to depth of water, holes, etc.), but also extends to metaphorical and emotional contexts. It can describe profound thoughts, deep emotions, intense feelings, dark colors or shadows, significant changes, and thorough understanding. The word is used with the genitive singular form 'sügava' and plural 'sügavad', while in partitive it becomes 'sügavat'."
