  "context": "The Estonian word 'söök' means meal or food. It can refer to a specific dish being served, the general concept of food as sustenance, or a complete meal eaten at a particular time. The word has different grammatical forms depending on its usage in sentences - for example, 'söök' (nominative), 'sööki' (partitive accusative), and 'söögi' (genitive). It's commonly used to refer to both the act of eating ('söömine') as well as the food itself."
