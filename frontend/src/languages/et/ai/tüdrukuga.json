  "context": "The Estonian word 'tüdrukuga' is a combination of 'tüdruk' (girl) and the elative case ending '-ga', which indicates accompaniment or association. It translates to English as 'with the girl' or 'alongside the girl'. The elative case in Estonian typically shows movement away from something, but when used with nouns it can indicate accompaniment or being together with someone/something. In this form, '-ga' functions similarly to the comitative case in other languages."
