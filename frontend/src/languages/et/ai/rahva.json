  "context": "The word 'rahva' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'rahvas', which means 'people'. In English, it translates to expressions like 'of the people' or 'people's'. It indicates possession or belonging - something that belongs to the people or affects the people. The genitive case shows a relationship between nouns, similar to how we use possessive forms in English."
