  "context": "The Estonian word 'lihtsalt' can have multiple meanings depending on context. It often means 'simply' or 'just' when used as an adverb to emphasize simplicity or straightforwardness, but it can also mean 'easy' or 'simple' in certain contexts. As a noun, 'lihtsus' (from the same root) means simplicity. The word derives from 'lihts-' meaning simple/plain, plus '-t' which forms adjectives and '-lt' which forms adverbs."
