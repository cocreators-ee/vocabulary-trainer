  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'lihtsalt' is a versatile word that can mean 'simply', 'just', or 'only'. It's used to indicate something is straightforward, uncomplicated, or serves as an intensifier. As shown in the dictionary definitions, it has several key uses: 1) To describe things that are simple or basic (like a simply decorated apartment), 2) As an adverb for emphasis with words like 'unbelievable', 'excellent', etc., and 3) To indicate exclusivity or limitation when meaning 'only' or 'nothing more than'. It often appears in contexts where the speaker wants to emphasize simplicity, directness, or restrictiveness of something."
