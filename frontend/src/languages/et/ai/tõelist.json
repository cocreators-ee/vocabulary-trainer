  "context": "The Estonian word 'tõelist' is an adverbial form of the adjective 'tõene' (true/real), used to express genuineness or sincerity. It often appears in constructions with the partitive case, similar to how English uses 'truly' or 'really'. The '-ist' suffix indicates this adverbial form, modifying verbs to indicate that something is done genuinely or truthfully."
