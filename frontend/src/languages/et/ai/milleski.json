  "context": "The word 'milleski' is an Estonian adverb that expresses uncertainty or vagueness. It's formed from the interrogative pronoun 'millal' (when) with the suffix '-ski', which indicates approximation or vagueness. The word suggests something happened without a clear reason or in an unspecified manner, similar to English expressions like 'somehow', 'in some way', or 'for some reason'. It often appears when the speaker cannot provide a specific explanation for an event or situation."
