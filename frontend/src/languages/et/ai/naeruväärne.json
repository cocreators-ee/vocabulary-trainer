  "context": "The Estonian word 'naeruväärne' is an adjective that describes something that causes laughter or is worthy of being laughed at. It's formed from 'naeru-' (laughter) + 'väärne' (worthy), literally meaning 'laugh-worthy'. The word can describe situations, people, or things that are so ridiculous, absurd, or comical that they provoke laughter rather than serious consideration."
