  "context": "'Tahtsin' is the first-person singular past indicative form of the Estonian verb 'tahtma', which means 'to want' or 'to wish'. It translates to English as 'I wanted'. This word appears in contexts where someone expresses a desire or intention they had in the past. For example, when someone says 'Tegin seda vastu oma tahtmist,' it means 'I did this against my will/wishes.' The verb 'tahtma' is fundamental in expressing personal desires and intentions in Estonian."
