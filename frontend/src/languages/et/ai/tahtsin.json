  "context": "The word 'tahtsin' is the first person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'tahma', which means 'to want' or 'to wish'. It indicates a past desire or intention. The '-in' suffix marks it as being in the past tense, specifically for the 1st person singular (I). This would be equivalent to saying 'I wanted to' or 'I meant to' in English."
