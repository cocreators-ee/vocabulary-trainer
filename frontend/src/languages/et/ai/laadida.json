  "context": "In Estonian, 'laadida' is primarily used to mean loading or reloading a firearm. The word comes from the military context where it refers to putting ammunition into a weapon for firing. It can also be used more broadly in technology contexts (like loading software), but its core meaning relates to weapons and ammunition."
