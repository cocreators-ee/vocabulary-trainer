  "context": "In Estonian, 'neid' has two main meanings: 1) As a poetic or literary term for girls/young women, used in expressions like 'nägus neid' (beautiful girl), and 2) In the partitive case as either the partitive form of 'nemad' (they/them) meaning 'them', or as the partitive form of 'need' (these/those) meaning 'of these/these ones'. The dictionary also shows it can refer to female juniors in sports contexts."
