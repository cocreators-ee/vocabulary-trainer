  "context": "The Estonian word 'kirjuta' is a verb that means to write or to put something in written form. It's the imperative/command form of the infinitive 'kirjutada'. This word can be used in various contexts such as asking someone to write down information, signing documents (as in putting one's signature), or recording things in writing. In the context provided by the dictionary definitions, it appears primarily with 'alla' meaning 'down', so 'kirjuta alla' would mean 'write down'."
