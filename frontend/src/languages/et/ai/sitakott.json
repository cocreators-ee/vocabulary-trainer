  "context": "The word 'sitakott' appears to be an Estonian word, but it's not immediately clear what it means. I'll try to analyze this word: 'istu-' relates to sitting or being seated (from the verb istuda - to sit), and '-kott' could mean bag or sack in some contexts. However, I'm not confident about this analysis as I don't recognize this specific word form in Estonian. It might be a specialized term or potentially a misunderstanding of the word form."
