  "context": "The word 'silmi' is the partitive form of the Estonian noun 'silm', which means 'eye'. In this context, it appears to be used in an idiomatic expression 'silmi ja kõrvu' (with eyes and ears) that emphasizes careful attention or vigilance. The phrase suggests being very attentive, watching and listening carefully for something. This is similar to English expressions like 'eyes and peeled' or 'keeping your eyes and ears open'."
