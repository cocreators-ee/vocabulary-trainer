It indicates a temporary situation up to a certain point in time when something else will happen. In the example sentences, it's used to suggest someone sit down for now until more time passes, to say goodbye temporarily with the promise of meeting again later in the evening, and to invite guests inside in the meantime until neighbors return home."
