  "context": "The word 'juures' in Estonian is a versatile postposition and adverb with multiple related meanings. As a postposition, it indicates proximity (near/beside/at someone's place), accompaniment (with someone), or association (about something). For example: 'akna juures' means 'near the window', 'ema juures' can mean 'at mother's place' or 'with mother'. As an adverb, it describes objects having certain qualities ('sokkidel on hais juures') - your socks have a stench. It also indicates addition ('uusi inimesi juures' means there are new people added). The meaning depends heavily on context and can indicate physical location, association, or possession."
