  "context": "The word 'tulnukate' in Estonian refers to a linguistic substratum or the underlying language layer that influences another language. It comes from 'tulnukas' meaning foreign/strange, and when used in plural form 'tulnukate', it specifically refers to elements of substrate languages - remnants of an older, replaced language that still remain in vocabulary, pronunciation, or grammar structures of a newer language."
