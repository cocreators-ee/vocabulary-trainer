  "context": "The word 'litapoeg' is a compound Estonian noun combining 'litas' (a dialectal/archaic form of 'lihtsus' meaning simplicity or possibly referring to a type of animal) with 'poeg' (meaning son or young male animal). In modern usage, it specifically refers to a young male lynx. This word would be used when talking about baby lynxes in the wild, particularly focusing on male cubs. The structure follows Estonian compound noun patterns where descriptive elements are combined with 'poeg' to create specific terms for young animals."
