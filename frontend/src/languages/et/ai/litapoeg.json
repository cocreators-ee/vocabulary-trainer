  "context": "The word 'litapoeg' is an Estonian vulgarity that combines 'lita' (likely derived from Russian curse words) with 'poeg' (meaning 'son'). It's used as an insult similar to English curses like 'bastard' or 'son of a bitch.' The term expresses anger and contempt toward someone, typically addressing them directly. In the example sentence 'Pea suu, kuradi litapoeg!', it's telling someone to shut up while calling them a damn bastard/son of a bitch."
