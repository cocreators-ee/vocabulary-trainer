  "context": "The word 'vasakul' is an Estonian adverb meaning 'on the left side' or 'to the left'. It describes position relative to the left direction. The '-ul' ending indicates location, similar to how English uses prepositions like 'on', 'at', or 'in' for positional information. This form would typically be used after verbs of motion or when indicating a static position."
