  "context": "The Estonian word 'istub' literally means 'sits' but is used idiomatically to describe situations where someone acts against their own self-interest or creates problems for themselves. It comes from the imagery of sitting on a branch that you are sawing off - essentially, creating your own downfall through poor judgment."
