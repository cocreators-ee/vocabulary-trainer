  "context": "The Estonian verb 'astuda' means to step or move forward into a position, space, or organization. It can be used literally for stepping upward or entering a physical space, but it's also commonly used metaphorically for joining an institution (like enrolling in university), starting a new job, or taking legal action by entering court proceedings."
