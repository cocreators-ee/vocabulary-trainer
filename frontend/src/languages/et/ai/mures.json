  "context": "The word 'mures' in Estonian means to be worried or concerned about something. It's often used with the preposition 'pärast' (about/for) followed by what is being worried about. The phrase 'hallid juuksed kasvatama' literally means 'to grow grey hairs', which is an idiom equivalent to English expressions like 'worrying yourself sick' or 'getting gray hair from worrying'. It's a colloquial expression showing excessive worry that can lead to premature aging (grey hairs)."
