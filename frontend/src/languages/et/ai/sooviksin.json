  "context": "'sooviksin' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'soovima', which means 'to wish' or 'to want'. It expresses a desire or preference in the past or hypothetical situation, similar to how we use 'would like' or 'would want' in English. In the provided example sentence, it shows what someone would prefer when putting a phone away - they would like a white device/apparatus."
