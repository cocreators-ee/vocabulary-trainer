  "context": "In Estonian, 'vastane' is a noun that means opponent or enemy. It's the nominative singular form of the word. When used in different cases, it changes form to indicate grammatical relationships - for example in partitive case it might be 'vastast'. In plural form it becomes 'vastased'. The word is commonly used in contexts referring to competitors in sports, rivals in games, or adversaries in more serious conflicts."
