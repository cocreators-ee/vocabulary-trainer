  "context": "Mina is the Estonian pronoun for 'I' or 'me'. It's used to refer to oneself in the first person singular. The dictionary shows it has different forms depending on grammatical case: mine (nominative), mind (genitive), minule (allative), etc. In some contexts, it can also have a sense of emphasis, like just me or indeed me."
