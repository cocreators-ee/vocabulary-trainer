  "context": "In Estonian, 'mina' is the first-person singular pronoun meaning 'I'. It's used to refer to oneself when speaking. The word can be declined in different cases (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.), and there are also plural forms like 'me' for 'we'. In examples, 'mina olen eestlane' means 'I am Estonian', 'mina ei tea vastust' means 'I don't know the answer', and 'minu nimi on Anna' shows the genitive form meaning 'my name is Anna'. The word follows Estonian grammar rules for pronoun declension."
