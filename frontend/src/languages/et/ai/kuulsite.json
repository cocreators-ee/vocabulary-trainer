  "context": "The word 'kuulsite' is the 2nd person plural past tense form of the Estonian verb 'kuulma', which means 'to hear' or 'to listen'. In this context, it appears to be used as an imperative phrase meaning 'Listen!' or 'Did you hear?' to get attention. The word seems to be part of a larger narrative excerpt where someone is expressing frustration about being followed by inexperienced young men (josplid)."
