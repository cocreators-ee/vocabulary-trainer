  "context": "The Estonian word 'kuradima' is an intensifier used to emphasize adjectives and adverbs. It functions similarly to English words like 'very', 'extremely', or 'terribly'. It's a colloquial intensifier that can convey strong emphasis, sometimes with negative connotations depending on context. The word derives from 'kurat' (devil/crap) but is used milder than its root form when functioning as an intensifier."
