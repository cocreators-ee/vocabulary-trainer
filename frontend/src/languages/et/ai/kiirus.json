  "context": "The Estonian word 'kiirus' primarily means speed or velocity. It can refer to the physical speed of moving objects (like cars, trains, rockets), as well as the rate at which processes occur (such as working speed, reaction time, or growth rate). The word comes from the adjective 'kiire' meaning fast/quick and the suffix '-us', which forms abstract nouns. It has multiple grammatical forms including genitive 'kiiruse', partitive 'kiirust', and plural form 'kiirused'."
