  "context": "In Estonian, 'õnnetus' primarily refers to an unfortunate event or accident. It can mean a physical accident (like a traffic accident), but it also carries the meaning of misfortune or bad luck in more general contexts. The word is derived from 'õnn' (happiness) with a negative prefix, literally meaning 'un-happiness'. In compound words like 'liiklusõnnetus', it specifically refers to types of accidents."
