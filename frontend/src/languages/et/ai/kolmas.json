  "context": "The word 'kolmas' is the Estonian ordinal number meaning 'third'. It's used to indicate position in a sequence or order. As an adjective, it agrees with the noun it modifies in case and gender. For example: 'kolmas inimene' (the third person), 'kolmas p√§ev' (the third day). The word form remains consistent regardless of case endings when modifying nouns."
