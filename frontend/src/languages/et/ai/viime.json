  "context": "The word 'viime' has multiple meanings depending on context. In the given example from the dictionary, it appears to be part of the phrase 'viime sünnipäevalapsele nelke' where it seems to mean 'take' or 'carry'. However, 'viime' could also be a form of the verb 'viiama' (to take/bring) in some contexts. The dictionary primarily shows it as being associated with carnations ('nelk'), but this might be part of the phrase rather than the word's primary meaning."
