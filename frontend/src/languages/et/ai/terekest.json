  "context": "Terekest is an Estonian interjection used as a greeting or farewell. It's derived from 'tere' (hello/greeting) and '-kest' which appears to be an intensifying suffix in this context. The word appears to be a more emphatic version of the standard Estonian greeting 'tere'. It can be used both when meeting someone and when parting, similar to how some English speakers might say 'Hello then!' or 'Good day then!' with emphasis."
