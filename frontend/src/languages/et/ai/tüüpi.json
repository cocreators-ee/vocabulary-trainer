  "context": "The Estonian word 'tüüpi' appears to be the adessive case form of 'tüüp', which means 'type' or 'kind'. In the adessive case (ending -i), it would typically mean 'with type' or 'in terms of type'. However, without more context, this could also potentially represent a misspelling or variation of other words. The word is commonly used in Estonian to refer to categories or classifications of things."
