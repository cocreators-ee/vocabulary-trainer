  "context": "The Estonian word 'huvi' has two main meanings. First, it means interest, attention, or concern - a mental focus on something one wants to learn about or acquire. Second, in plural form (huvide), it can mean interests, advantages, benefits, or what someone seeks to gain. It's used both for personal interests and for collective/group benefits."
