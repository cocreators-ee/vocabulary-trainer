  "context": "The Estonian word 'kaela' is the genitive singular form of 'kael', which means neck. The genitive case in Estonian indicates possession or relationship - so 'kaela' would translate to 'of the neck' or indicate that something belongs to or relates to the neck. This form is commonly used when describing attributes of someone's neck or items worn on the neck."
