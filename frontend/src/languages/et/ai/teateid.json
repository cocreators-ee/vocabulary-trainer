  "context": "The word 'teateid' is the partitive plural form of the Estonian noun 'teade', which means message, news, or report. The '-id' ending indicates it's in plural form, and the '-d' at the end shows it's in the partitive case. In Estonian grammar, the partitive case is often used with quantities or when referring to some of something. So 'teateid' specifically means 'messages/news/reports (in partitive case)' and would typically be used contexts like getting some messages, receiving news items, or having reports."
