  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõtle' is the imperative form of the verb 'mõtlema,' which means to think. It's used when telling someone to think about something or to consider matters carefully. This can involve complex mental activity, considering thoughts about someone or something, planning, imagining, or even forming opinions. In its imperative form, it directly commands someone to think."
