  "context": "The word 'teiega' is a case form in Estonian that means 'with you' (plural formal). It's part of the adessive case used to indicate accompaniment or instrumentality. In expressions like 'Pagan teiega', it functions as an intensifier meaning 'anyway' or 'nevertheless' when used with dismissive or emphatic tone, similar to how 'for God's sake' might be used in English but without religious connotations."
