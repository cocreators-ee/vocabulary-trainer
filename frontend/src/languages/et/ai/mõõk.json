  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõõk' is a noun that refers to a sword or blade - an ancient cutting/cold weapon with one or two sharp edges used for cutting or thrusting. It's derived from Proto-Finnic and ultimately Proto-Germanic roots, showing its historical connection to other Germanic languages. The word has various declensions in Estonian including genitive 'mõõga', partitive 'mõõka', and is also used metaphorically to represent violence or military power."
