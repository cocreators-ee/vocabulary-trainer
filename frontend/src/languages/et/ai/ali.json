  "context": "The Estonian word 'ali' appears to be a variant spelling of the Estonian word 'kokku', which when combined with other morphemes forms words related to meetings, gatherings, or encounters. However, based on the provided dictionary definitions and examples, it seems that 'ali' might actually be referring to the name 'Muhammed Ali' (the famous boxer) in the second example sentence. In the context of Estonian language learning, this appears to be either a proper name (Ali as a surname) or potentially an incomplete word fragment rather than a standalone Estonian vocabulary word."
