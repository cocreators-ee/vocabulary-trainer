  "context": "Tegemist is the partitive singular form of tegemine, meaning 'matter' or 'concern'. In Estonian, it's often used in expressions like 'käed tegemist täis' which literally means 'hands full of matter/business', but idiomatically refers to being very busy with work or having many tasks to handle. The word indicates a situation where someone is occupied with something important or has many responsibilities."
