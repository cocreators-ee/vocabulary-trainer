  "context": "The Estonian word 'just' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings depending on context. It can indicate exact timing ('just at the right time'), recent past events ('I just got home'), or serve as an intensifier that softens statements ('He isn't much of a worker'). It's also used to emphasize agreement or correctness ('Just exactly!') and in conditional clauses for possible situations. Its meaning shifts based on intonation, context, and surrounding words."
