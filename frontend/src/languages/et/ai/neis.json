  "context": "The word 'neis' is a shortened form of the Estonian word 'bakteriofaag' (bacteriophage). It refers to a virus that infects and destroys bacteria. The '-i' ending in 'bakteriofaag-i' indicates possession or relation, and when it becomes 'neis', it's an informal or abbreviated form commonly used in biological contexts to refer specifically to bacteriophages. Bacteriophages are important tools in microbiology for bacterial control and research."
