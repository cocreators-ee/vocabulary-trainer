  "context": "The word 'kaitset' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'kaitse', which means 'protection' or 'defense'. The partitive case in Estonian is used to indicate an incomplete action, an object affected by an action, or to specify a quantity/amount. In this form, it typically appears after verbs like 'on' (is), 'vajalik' (necessary), or when talking about having something ('meil on kaitset' - we have protection)."
