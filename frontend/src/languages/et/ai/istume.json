  "context": "The word 'istume' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'istuma', which means 'to sit'. In this conjugated form, it translates to English as 'we sit' or 'we are sitting', and can also be used in an inclusive sense like 'let's sit' when addressing a group including oneself. This is formed from the root verb with the -me suffix indicating 1st person plural subject."
