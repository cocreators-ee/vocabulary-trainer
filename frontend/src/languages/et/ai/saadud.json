  "context": "The Estonian word 'saadud' is the past participle form of the verb 'saa', which means 'to get' or 'to receive'. It describes something that has been obtained, received, acquired, or achieved. The word can be used in various contexts such as receiving an education, obtaining a new building/house, or achieving a good decision. As a past participle, it typically follows the verb 'olema' (to be) to form compound tenses."
