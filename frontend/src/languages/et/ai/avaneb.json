  "context": "The word 'avaneb' is the 3rd person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'avama', which means 'to open'. It describes something that opens, unfolds, or reveals itself. This could refer to physical objects like doors or packages, but in this context from the dictionary definition, it specifically refers to how a botanical fruit called 'kukkurvili' (a pod-like dry fruit) opens along one seam."
