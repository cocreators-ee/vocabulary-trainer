  "context": "The word 'saanud' is the past active participle of the Estonian verb 'saama'. It means having reached, arrived, obtained, or managed to do something. In the negative form shown in the example sentence 'Vanatädi polnud jalagagi, jalga teatrisse saanud,' it indicates that someone had not even gotten their feet somewhere (in this case, to the theater). The word can be used to indicate completion or achievement of an action."
