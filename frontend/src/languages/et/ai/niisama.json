  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'niisama' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'without special purpose or reason', used casually or without particular intention (e.g., doing something just because). In comparisons, it means 'the same' or 'similarly'. It also functions as 'also' or 'too' when adding information similar to what was just mentioned. It's a versatile adverb that connects ideas either through similarity or through casualness."
