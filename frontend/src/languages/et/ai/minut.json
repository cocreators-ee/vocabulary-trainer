  "context": "In Estonian, 'minut' is a noun that means a minute as a unit of time. It's equivalent to 1/60th of an hour or 60 seconds. The word can also refer to short periods of time or moments. In the dictionary, it's noted that in expressions like 'iga minut' (every minute) or 'viimane minut' (the last minute), it conveys urgency or critical timing. Estonian follows a declension pattern where 'minut' changes form depending on grammatical case - for example, genitive is 'minuti', partitive is 'minutit', etc."
