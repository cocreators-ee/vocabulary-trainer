  "context": "The Estonian word 'minut' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'minute' as in a unit of time (60 seconds), or it can be the partitive case form of 'mina' meaning 'me/my'. In the first example, 'Ma ootan minut' uses it to mean 'I wait for a minute/moment'. The second example shows appreciation for a good moment/time. The third example demonstrates possessive usage as in 'my name' when combined with other words."
