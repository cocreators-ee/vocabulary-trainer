  "context": "The Estonian word 'üllatunud' is the past participle form of the verb 'ullata', meaning 'to surprise'. It describes a state of being surprised or astonished. As a past participle, it typically follows the auxiliary verb 'olema' (to be) to form compound tenses, such as 'Ma olin üllatunud' (I was surprised). The word is commonly used in everyday Estonian to express an unexpected reaction to news, events, or outcomes."
