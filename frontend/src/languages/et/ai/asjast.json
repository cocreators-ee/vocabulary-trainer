  "context": "The Estonian word 'asjast' is an elative case form of the noun 'asi', meaning 'matter', 'subject', or 'thing'. In the elative case, it indicates movement from within something or separation, but when used with prepositions or in certain contexts, it functions to indicate what a discussion or thought is about. It essentially means 'about the matter' or 'regarding the subject'."
