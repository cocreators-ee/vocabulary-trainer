  "context": "The word 'asjast' is part of the compound word 'asjahuviline' which means interested or enthusiastic about something. It's derived from 'asi' (matter, thing) and 'huviline' (interesting). In Estonian, '-st' can be a case ending indicating origin or source, but here it appears to be part of the larger compound adjective meaning 'interested in matters/subjects'. The word is used to describe people who show genuine interest and enthusiasm for particular topics, activities, or professions."
