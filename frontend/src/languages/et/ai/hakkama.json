  "context": "The Estonian word 'hakkama' is a versatile verb that primarily means to start, begin or commence an activity or process. It can be used with both persons and impersonal constructions. For example, it describes when someone begins doing something (like reading - hakkame lugema), when some natural process starts (like laughing - ta hakkas naerma), or when a situation develops from certain circumstances (like everything starting from this point - kõik hakkas sellest). It's one of the most common and useful verbs in Estonian for expressing initiation."
