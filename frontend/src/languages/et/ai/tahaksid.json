  "context": "The word 'tahaksid' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'taha' (to want). It specifically means 'you would want/like' in a polite or hypothetical situation. This is the second person singular conditional form, often used to make requests or suggestions in a more indirect and polite manner than the direct present tense."
