  "context": "'lasi' is the third-person singular past form of the Estonian verb 'laskma', which means 'to let' or 'allow'. It describes someone permitting or allowing something to happen in the past. This form indicates that a single person (third person) performed this action in the past tense. For example, if a teacher allowed students to play, you would say 'Ta lasi lapsed mängida' - meaning 'He/she let/allowed the children to play'."
