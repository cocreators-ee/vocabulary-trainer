  "context": "The word 'lahkusid' is the past tense plural form of the Estonian verb 'lahkuma', meaning 'to leave' or 'to depart'. It specifically refers to a group of people who have left or departed from a place. The '-sid' ending indicates this is past tense and plural form, so it translates as 'they left' or 'you (plural) left' depending on the context."
