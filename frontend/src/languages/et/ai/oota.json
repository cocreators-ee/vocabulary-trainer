  "context": "The Estonian interjection 'oota' is used to command someone to stop, wait, or hold on. It's similar to English words like 'halt', 'stop', or 'wait'. This word appears to be an exclamation used by guards or authorities to make someone pause or refrain from moving forward. The dictionary examples show it being shouted by a guard and used in various contexts where someone needs to stop what they're doing immediately."
