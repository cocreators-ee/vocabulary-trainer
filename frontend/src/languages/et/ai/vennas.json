  "context": "The Estonian word 'vennas' is the inessive case (inessive -s suffix) of 'vend', which means 'brother'. The inessive case indicates location within or inside something, so 'vennas' would translate to 'in a brother' or 'among brothers', but it's commonly used when talking about being with one's brothers or the concept of brotherhood. In Estonian grammar, nouns have 14 cases, and the -s ending is added to the genitive stem for inessive case formation."
