  "context": "The Estonian word 'jõudma' has two main meanings: 1) To have the capability or ability to do something (similar to English 'to be able to' or 'can'), and 2) To arrive at a destination, to reach a place or state. The first meaning relates to physical strength, mental capacity, financial means, or temporal opportunity. The second meaning refers to arriving somewhere physically or reaching a particular condition, time period, or goal. It's an important verb with various conjugations including jõuan (I can/arrive), jõuad (you can/arrive), jõuab (he/she/it can/arrives)."
