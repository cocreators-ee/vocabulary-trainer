  "context": "'Oo' is an informal, colloquial form of the Estonian verb 'olema' (to be), specifically used in the present tense with the 2nd person singular 'you'. It's commonly used in everyday speech and corresponds to English 'are', 'is', or 'am' depending on context. This shortened form is typical in spoken language rather than formal writing."
