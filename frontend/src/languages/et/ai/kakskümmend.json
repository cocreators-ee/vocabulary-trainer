  "context": "The word 'kakskümmend' is the Estonian numeral for 20. It's a compound word formed from 'kaks' (two) and 'kümmend' (ten). In Estonian, numbers are often constructed by combining words rather than using unique terms for each number like in English. The word follows standard Estonian grammar patterns and can be used with case endings when needed."
