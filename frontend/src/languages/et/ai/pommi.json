  "context": "The Estonian word 'pommi' is the partitive form of 'pomm', which means 'bomb'. In this case, it's used to mean 'of a bomb' or 'related to bombs'. The partitive case in Estonian typically indicates partialness, but here it often appears with certain nouns when referring to specific instances or types of things. Pommi can refer to an actual explosive device, the concept of bombing, or bomb threats."
