  "context": "In Estonian, 'pommi' is an adverb meaning drunk or intoxicated. It's often used to describe someone who has consumed too much alcohol and is under its influence. The word comes from the Russian word for bomb ('бомба'), but in this context it refers to being extremely drunk rather than literal explosives."
