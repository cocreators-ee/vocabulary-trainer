  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõte' means thought or idea. It is a singular noun that refers to a mental concept, opinion, or consideration. In Estonian grammar, it's in the nominative case here. When used with different cases or plural forms, it would change accordingly - for example, 'mõttes' (in thought), 'mõtted' (thoughts)."
