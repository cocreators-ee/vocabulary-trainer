  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõte' is a versatile noun with multiple meanings depending on context. Its primary translations include 'thought', 'idea', 'opinion', 'meaning', and 'purpose'. As shown in the dictionary definitions, it can refer to: 1) individual thoughts or mental processes (e.g., 'head mõtted' means 'bad thoughts'), 2) opinions or viewpoints about matters, 3) thinking or contemplation itself ('mõtte areng' means development of thought), 4) intentions or plans ('mõte teoks' means to make an idea a reality), and 5) significance or purpose of something. The word declines regularly in Estonian grammar with forms like mõtted (plural nominative), mõtete (genitive plural), and mõttele (allative singular)."
