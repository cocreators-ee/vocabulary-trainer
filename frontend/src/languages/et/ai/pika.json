  "context": "In Estonian, 'pika' is the partitive form of the adjective 'pikk', meaning 'long' or 'tall'. It's used when referring to a long object or person in the context of quantity, extent, or measurement. When talking about a tall person (as opposed to height generally), the nominative form 'pikk' would be more common, but 'pika' can appear in certain expressions or contexts where the partitive case is required."
