  "context": "In Estonian, 'pika' is the genitive singular form of the adjective 'pikk' (long). In the expression 'pika nina saama' it literally means 'to get a long nose,' but idiomatically refers to being disappointed, frustrated, or coming back empty-handed after an effort. It's similar to English expressions like 'coming away with nothing' or 'being left with egg on one's face.' The phrase often appears in contexts where someone searches for something without finding it, resulting in frustration."
