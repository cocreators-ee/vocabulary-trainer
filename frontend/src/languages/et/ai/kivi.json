  "context": "The Estonian word 'kivi' primarily means stone or rock. It's a versatile noun that can refer to natural mineral substances in nature, construction materials, gemstones, seeds with hard shells in fruits, game pieces, and even slang terms for drugs. The word appears in numerous compound words where it specifies the type of stone (e.g., põlevkivi = oil shale, graniitkivi = granite). In different grammatical forms, 'kivi' can be used to indicate location with stones ('kivil' = on a stone), movement toward them ('kivile' = to a stone), or accompaniment ('kiviga' = with a stone)."
