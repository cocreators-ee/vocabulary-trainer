  "context": "The Estonian word 'ainus' has multiple meanings depending on context. As an adjective, it means 'only,' 'sole,' or 'single,' indicating that there is just one of something (e.g., 'the only known venomous snake'). It can also refer to a unique or exclusive thing. In poetic contexts, as a noun, 'ainus' means 'loved one' or 'darling.' The word changes form based on grammatical case - nominative form is 'ainus,' genitive can be 'ainsa' or 'ainu,' and partitive can be 'ainsat' or 'ainust.'"
