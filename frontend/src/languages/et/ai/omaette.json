  "context": "The Estonian word 'omaette' is an adverb that means something exists separately or independently, as if it has its own distinct character or identity. It's often used to describe something that stands on its own, either physically or conceptually, rather than being part of a larger whole. The word combines 'oma' (own) and 'ette' (separate/forward), creating the meaning of 'being separate in itself'."
