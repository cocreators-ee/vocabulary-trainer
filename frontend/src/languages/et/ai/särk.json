  "context": "In Estonian, 'särk' is a versatile word for a type of upper body garment. It primarily refers to shirts worn by men, women, and children, often covering the torso (usually closed in front without sleeves or with short/long sleeves). The word can also describe undershirts, blouses, and various tops made from different materials like cotton, silk, nylon, etc. 'Särk' appears in many compound words specifying types of shirts such as 'öösärk' (nightshirt), 'spordisärk' (sports shirt), 'polosärk' (polo shirt), etc. The word is commonly used in everyday contexts for describing different kinds of upper body garments."
