  "context": "The Estonian word 'kõrini' is an adverb that indicates something has been done to the utmost degree or extreme. It can describe filling something completely (like eating or drinking), but more commonly expresses being fed up, tired, or having had enough of something or someone. In its negative usage, it conveys strong annoyance, frustration, or saturation with a situation, person, or repeated action."
