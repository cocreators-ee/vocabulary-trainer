  "context": "The word 'jääge' is the plural imperative form of the Estonian verb 'jääma', which means 'to stay', 'to remain', or 'to keep'. In the context provided, it appears to be used as a command telling someone to stay put and not chase anyone away. The dictionary definitions focus more on other related verbs like 'tagasi ajama' (to drive back), but in this specific usage with the imperative form, it clearly means 'stay'."
