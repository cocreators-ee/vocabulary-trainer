  "context": "The word 'mõtlesime' is the past tense plural form of the verb 'mõtlema' in Estonian, which means 'to think'. The '-me' ending indicates first person plural (we), and this form would translate to English as 'we thought' or 'we considered'. It's commonly used when referring to a group thinking about something together in the past."
