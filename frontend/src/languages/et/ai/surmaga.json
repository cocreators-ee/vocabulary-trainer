  "context": "The word 'surmaga' is an Estonian adverbial form that means 'with death', 'deadly', or 'fatally'. It's derived from the root word 'surm' (death) and the '-ga' suffix which indicates accompaniment or instrumentality. In this context, it often appears in phrases describing fatal outcomes or deadly conditions, such as 'surmaga lõppev' meaning 'ending with death' or 'fatal'."
