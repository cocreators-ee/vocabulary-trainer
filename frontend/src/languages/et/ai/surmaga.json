  "context": "The Estonian word 'surmaga' is a postposition or adverbial case form that combines the noun 'surm' (death) with the suffix '-ga', which indicates accompaniment, association, or being together with something. It literally translates to 'with death' or 'accompanied by death'. This construction is commonly used in Estonian to express being associated with death, facing death, or being connected to death in some way."
