  "context": "The word 'sõrmuse' appears to be in the partitive case of the Estonian noun 'sõrmus', which means 'ring'. In Estonian, the partitive case is often used for objects that are being acted upon or when referring to a quantity of something. The basic form 'sõrmus' refers to a ring as jewelry, particularly a finger ring. It could refer to an engagement ring, wedding band, signet ring, or any type of finger ring."
