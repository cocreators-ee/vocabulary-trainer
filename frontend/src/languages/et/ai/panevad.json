  "context": "The word 'panevad' is the 3rd person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'panema', which means 'to put', 'to place', or 'to set'. It indicates that multiple people are performing the action of putting, placing, or setting something somewhere. This form follows the conjugation pattern where the infinitive '-ma' ending is replaced with '-evad' for 3rd person plural present tense."
