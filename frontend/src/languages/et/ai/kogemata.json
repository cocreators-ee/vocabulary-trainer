  "context": "The Estonian word 'kogemata' is an adverb that means 'accidentally' or 'unintentionally'. It describes actions done without intention, awareness, or planning. The word comes from 'koge-' (experience) with the suffix '-mata' indicating something not done. So it literally refers to something experienced unintentionally or without deliberate action."
