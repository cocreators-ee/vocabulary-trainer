  "context": "Kogemata is an Estonian adverb that means 'unintentionally', 'accidentally', or 'without intention'. It describes actions done without premeditation or deliberate intent, often resulting from carelessness or happenstance. This word can be used to qualify various types of actions - both physical movements (like stepping on someone) and more abstract situations (like revealing a secret). The Estonian prefix 'ko-' combined with 'gema' (to experience/try) forms this negation-of-intention concept."
