  "context": "The word 'lapsena' is an Estonian adessive case form of the noun 'laps' (child), meaning 'as a child' or 'when I was a child'. In Estonian grammar, the adessive case typically indicates location near something or means 'with', but when used with temporal expressions like this, it functions similarly to English phrases indicating time periods during someone's childhood. The -ena suffix is added to the stem of the word to form this case."
