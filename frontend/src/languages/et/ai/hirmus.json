  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'hirmus' is used as an intensifier meaning 'terribly', 'extremely', or 'very much'. It's similar in function to how English speakers might use words like 'really' or 'very' but with stronger emphasis. The word comes from the same root as 'hirm' (fear/dread), suggesting it conveys a sense of something being dreadfully or awfully intense."
