  "context": "The word 'juukseid' is the partitive form of 'juuksed', which means 'hair' in Estonian. In this form, it typically refers to individual strands or portions of hair rather than hair as a whole concept. The partitive case is used when talking about an unspecified amount or some of something, so 'juukseid' would translate to 'some hair' or refer to specific strands of hair."
