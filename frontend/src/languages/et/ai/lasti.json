  "context": "The word 'lasti' is the past tense third-person singular form of the verb 'lastama', which means to cast or ballot. It specifically refers to the historical practice of voting by dropping balls (kuulikeseid) into a closed box. This was an early method of secret voting where voters would physically cast their votes by placing balls into containers."
