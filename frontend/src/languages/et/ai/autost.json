  "context": "The Estonian word 'autost' is a compound element that means 'from the car' or 'without leaving the car'. It's used as a prefix in compound nouns to indicate services or facilities accessible without exiting your vehicle, such as drive-in restaurants, banks, or cinemas. The term comes from combining 'auto' (car) with the ablative case ending '-st', indicating movement away from something or starting point."
