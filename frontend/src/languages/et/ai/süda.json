  "context": "The Estonian word 'süda' has multiple meanings. Its primary meaning is 'heart' as the anatomical organ that pumps blood through the body. It also refers to the center or core of something, both physically (like the center of a city) and metaphorically (as in the heart of emotions). Additionally, it can mean character or disposition when describing someone's personality traits such as kindness or generosity. In emotional contexts, it represents feelings and inner experiences, often used in expressions about love, courage, and various emotional states."
