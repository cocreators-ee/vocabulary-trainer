  "context": "The Estonian word 'süda' primarily means 'heart', but it can also refer to the center or core of something. It's often used metaphorically to describe emotional matters, as in expressions about having a good heart ('hea südamelik'). In its basic form, 'süda' is the nominative singular, and it appears in various compounds and expressions throughout Estonian."
