  "context": "The Estonian word 'selleks' is an adverbial phrase used to indicate the reason or purpose behind an action. It literally means 'for that' and combines 'see' (that/this) with the '-ks' suffix which indicates a purpose or goal. The word typically appears at the beginning of a sentence clause where it introduces the reason why something is done, similar to English phrases like 'in order to,' 'so as to,' or simply 'for that purpose.'"
