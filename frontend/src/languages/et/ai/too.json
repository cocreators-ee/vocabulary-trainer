  "context": "The Estonian word 'too' is a demonstrative pronoun and adjective that means 'that' or 'those'. It's used to point to something specific, either physically present in the environment or mentioned earlier in conversation. The word has different forms depending on case, number, and grammatical function - it can appear as 'too' (singular nominative), 'tolle' (genitive), 'toda' (partitive), and other case forms. In plural form, it becomes 'nood'. This is primarily used by speakers in Southern Estonia."
