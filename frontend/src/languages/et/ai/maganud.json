  "context": "\"Maganud\" is the past participle of the Estonian verb \"magama\", which means \"to sleep\". It indicates that someone has already completed the action of sleeping. In English, this corresponds to the perfect tenses: present perfect (have/has slept) or past perfect (had slept). The form \"maganud\" is used when the subject is singular and in the nominative case. For example, \"Mulan on maganud terve öö\" means \"Mulan has slept all night\"."
