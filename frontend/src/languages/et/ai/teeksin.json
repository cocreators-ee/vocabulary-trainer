  "context": "The word 'teeksin' is the first person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'tegema', which means 'to do' or 'to make'. It appears in the dictionary example sentence where it's used with the modal verb peaksin (should) to indicate a hypothetical action that would require being foolish ('arulage'). In this context, if I were to do that (teeksin), I should be foolish. This shows how teeksin functions as past tense expressing completed actions or conditional scenarios."
