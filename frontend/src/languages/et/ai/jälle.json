  "context": "The Estonian word 'jälle' is an adverb that means 'again' or 'once more'. It can be used to indicate repetition of an action or return to a previous state. In the first sense, it appears when someone will come again, something happens once more (like rain falling), or spring comes around again. In its second meaning, 'jälle' is used for contrast in position, similar to English words like 'on the other hand', 'likewise', or 'whereas'. It can be placed between two contrasting elements to show opposition or comparison."
