  "context": "The Estonian word 'eelmise' appears to be a typographical error in the dictionary definitions provided. Based on context, it seems you're actually asking about 'ega', which is an important conjunction used in Estonian to connect negative elements in sentences and has multiple functions including expressing 'and neither', 'also not', 'nor either', or 'but also not'. It's commonly used at the beginning of clauses to link with previous negations, often functioning as a discourse marker that connects the current clause to what was just said. When used at the beginning of questions, it can create tag questions where the speaker expects agreement. The word shows grammatical versatility in connecting both subjects and objects in negative constructions."
