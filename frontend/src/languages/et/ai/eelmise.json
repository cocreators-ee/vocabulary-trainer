  "context": "The Estonian word 'eelmise' is the genitive singular form of the adjective 'eelmine', which means 'previous' or 'last'. It's used to indicate something that came before another in time or sequence. This form specifically shows possession or relationship with the thing being described (genitive case). The root 'eel-' comes from 'eel' meaning 'before', and '-m' is a common adjective-forming suffix, while '-se' indicates the genitive singular ending."
