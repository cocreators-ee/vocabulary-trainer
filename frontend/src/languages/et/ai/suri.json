  "context": "The word 'suri' is the past tense (third person singular) of the verb 'surma', which means 'to die'. It's commonly used to indicate that someone has died. In Estonian, death can be poetically referred to as the extinguishing of a 'life candle' ('eluküünal'), as shown in the dictionary definition where it says 'Kellegi eluküünalt kustutama, ära puhuma kedagi tapma', meaning 'to extinguish someone's life candle, blow it out - to kill someone'. Therefore, when saying that a 'vanake suri' (old person died), it can be understood as the old person's life candle going out."
