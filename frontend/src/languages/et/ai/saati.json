  "context": "The Estonian word 'saati' has two main uses: 1) As a postposition meaning 'since' when indicating the starting point of a time period (e.g., hommikust saati - since morning), and 2) As an adverb meaning 'let alone' or 'not to mention' used in comparative contexts where something is even less likely than what was previously mentioned. In spatial contexts, it can indicate 'up to' or 'until' a certain limit."
