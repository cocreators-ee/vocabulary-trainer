  "context": "The word 'mõtleme' is the 1st person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'mõtlema', which means 'to think'. It is formed by adding the suffix '-me' to the stem 'mõtl-' (from 'mõtle-'), indicating that we (the speaker and at least one other) are engaged in thinking or considering something. This is a common form used when suggesting collective thought processes or expressing current mental activity of a group."
