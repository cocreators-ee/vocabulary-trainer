  "context": "The Estonian word 'talu' refers to a small farm or homestead, typically a family-owned agricultural property with land and buildings. It's commonly used in rural contexts and can refer to both traditional farms and smaller agricultural holdings. The word is used similarly to how 'farm' is used in English, but often implies a more intimate, family-run operation rather than large-scale commercial agriculture."
