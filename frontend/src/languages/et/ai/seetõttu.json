  "context": "Seetõttu is an Estonian conjunction used to indicate a consequence or result. It connects a cause with its effect, similar to 'therefore' or 'that's why' in English. The word breaks down as 'see-' (this/that) + '-tõttu' (because of/due to), literally meaning 'because of this'. It is commonly used at the beginning of sentences to introduce a conclusion based on previously stated information."
