  "context": "The Estonian word 'seetõttu' is an adverb meaning 'because of that', 'for that reason', or 'therefore'. It's formed by combining 'see' (that/this) with 'tõttu' (because of/reason for), literally meaning 'because of that'. This conjunction indicates a causal relationship between two clauses, typically used to connect a cause and its effect. From the examples provided in the dictionary definitions, we can see it's commonly used in narrative contexts to explain why something happened."
