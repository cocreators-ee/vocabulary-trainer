  "context": "The Estonian word 'värske' means 'fresh', 'new', or 'recent'. It's commonly used to describe food that hasn't been stored for long (like fresh bread, milk, vegetables), but can also refer to something new or recent in time. When modifying a noun, it typically appears in the same case as the noun, and when used with certain prepositions like 'ga' (with), it might change form slightly."
