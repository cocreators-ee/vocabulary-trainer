  "context": "Kuhugi is an Estonian adverb meaning 'somewhere' or 'to someplace'. It indicates movement to an unspecified location. In negative sentences, it becomes 'mitte kuhugi' meaning 'nowhere' or 'not anywhere'. The word combines the interrogative/indefinite pronoun 'kuskil' (where) with the suffix '-gi' (also/either), creating this directional adverb indicating movement to some unspecified destination."
