  "context": "The word 'kuhugi' is an Estonian adverb that means 'somewhere' or 'to someplace'. It's formed from the interrogative pronoun 'kuhu' (where to) with the suffix '-gi', which adds a sense of uncertainty, approximation, or inclusiveness. This construction indicates movement toward an unspecified location. The word is commonly used when talking about going somewhere without specifying exactly where."
