  "context": "The Estonian word 'rühm' has multiple related meanings. Most commonly, it refers to a group or collection of people or things that are together for some purpose - like a team of boys playing outside, groups of sailors moving through town, or tourist groups in the old town. In military contexts specifically, it means platoon. It can also refer to clusters of objects like buildings or islands, and in more technical contexts, it can mean categories or classes (like blood types) or chemical groups in molecules."
