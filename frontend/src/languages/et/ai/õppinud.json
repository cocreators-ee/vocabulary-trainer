  "context": "Õppinud is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'õppima', which means 'to learn' or 'to study'. It indicates that someone has completed the action of learning something. The word can be used to describe what a person has learned (e.g., subjects, skills) where it typically follows the subject and often requires an object specifying what was learned."
