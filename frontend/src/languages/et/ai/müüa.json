  "context": "The word 'müüa' is the da-infinitive form of the verb 'müüma', which means 'to sell'. It is used to express the action of selling goods or services. In Estonian, this conjugation pattern follows the da-infinitive structure (-da ending), but in this case it appears as -a, which might be a specific inflection form or could be part of derivational morphology related to financial instruments based on one dictionary definition."
