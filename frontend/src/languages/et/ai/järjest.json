  "context": "The word 'järjest' is an Estonian adverb that indicates sequential or orderly progression. It means something should be done in a specific sequence, one item following another, rather than randomly or simultaneously. This word is commonly used when giving instructions about the order of tasks, describing events happening consecutively, or emphasizing systematic organization."
