  "context": "The Estonian word 'omanik' means owner or proprietor. It refers to the person who has legal ownership of something, such as property, a business, an object, or any item. The word is in nominative case here (subject form) and would change form depending on its grammatical role in a sentence. For example, it might become 'omanikku' (partitive case), 'omaniku' (genitive case), etc."
