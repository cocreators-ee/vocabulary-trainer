  "context": "The Estonian word 'ajasid' is the partitive plural form of 'aja', which means 'time'. It functions as an object indicating multiple instances or periods when something happened. This grammatical case shows what was affected by the action, and the plural indicates multiple occurrences rather than a single moment."
