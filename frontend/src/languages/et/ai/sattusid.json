  "context": "The word 'sattusid' is the past tense plural form of the Estonian verb 'sattuma'. It means to end up somewhere or in a situation by chance, without prior planning. The word implies that something happened accidentally or unexpectedly. In English, it can be translated as 'ended up', 'landed', 'found oneself', or 'chanced upon'. This is an imperfective verb aspect, which indicates ongoing or repeated actions in the past."
