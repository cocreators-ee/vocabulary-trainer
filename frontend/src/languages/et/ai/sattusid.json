  "context": "The word 'sattusid' is the past tense (plural) form of the Estonian verb 'satuma', which means to end up in a situation, to find oneself in a particular state or circumstance. It often implies an unintentional or accidental occurrence where someone finds themselves in a specific condition or place. The dictionary definition shows it can be used with 'jalgu' (literally 'feet') to indicate being in the midst of something difficult or dangerous, like war and battles."
