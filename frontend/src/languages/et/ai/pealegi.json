  "context": "The Estonian word 'pealegi' has three main meanings: 1) Used with imperative forms to express agreement or concession, similar to 'go ahead then' or 'do it anyway'; 2) Meaning 'in addition', 'besides', or 'on top of that' when adding further information; 3) Meaning 'repeatedly' or 'continuously' when describing persistent actions. The word can function as an adverb and is commonly used in everyday Estonian conversation to emphasize additional points, concessive situations, or repeated occurrences."
