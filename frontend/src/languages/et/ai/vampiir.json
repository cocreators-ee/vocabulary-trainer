  "context": "The Estonian word 'vampiir' refers to a vampire, which is both a zoological term for certain South and Central American bats that feed on blood, and in folklore, an evil supernatural being that sucks blood, usually appearing in human form. The word comes from German 'Vampir' and ultimately from Serbo-Croatian. In broader usage, it can metaphorically refer to someone or something that drains life force from others."
