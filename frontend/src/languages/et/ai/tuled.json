  "context": "The word 'tuled' in Estonian can have multiple meanings. As a verb form, it is the second-person singular present form of 'tulema' meaning 'to come', so you come/you are coming. When used with 'juba' (already), as shown in the example sentences, it means someone has already arrived or will arrive soon. The word can also be the nominative plural form of 'tuli' (fire), but without context suggesting fire, the verb interpretation is more likely."
