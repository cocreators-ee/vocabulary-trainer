  "context": "The word 'läheksin' is the first-person singular past tense form of the verb 'minema' (to go) in Estonian. It appears to be formed with a potential or conditional mood marker '-ks', suggesting something like 'I would go' or 'I might go'. However, based on the context provided in the dictionary definitions, it seems to function as part of expressions related to movement and direction. The dictionary shows examples where this form is used in questions about destinations ('Kuhu lähed?' - Where are you going?) and statements about movement ('Läheksin siit ära' - I would go from here)."
