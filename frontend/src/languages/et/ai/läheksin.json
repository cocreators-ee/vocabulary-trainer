  "context": "The word 'läheksin' is the first-person singular conditional form of the Estonian verb 'minema' (to go). It translates to English as 'I would go' or 'I would leave'. This form is used in hypothetical situations, wishes, polite requests, or when expressing future actions from a past perspective. The '-ks-' infix indicates the conditional mood, while the '-in' ending marks first-person singular agreement."
