  "context": "The word 'hommikust' is an Estonian adverb that functions as the elative case form of 'hommik' (morning). It indicates movement from or origin in time - specifically 'from the morning' or 'since morning'. The '-st' ending is characteristic of the elative case in Estonian, which shows direction away from something. In this context, it's temporal rather than spatial, indicating when something started or came from."
