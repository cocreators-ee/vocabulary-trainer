  "context": "The word 'kuulid' is the plural form of 'kuli', meaning bullets or ammunition in Estonian. It refers to the small metal projectiles that are fired from firearms. This word specifically denotes the actual projectiles/bullets themselves, not the complete cartridge which includes casing and powder. In Estonian military context, 'kuulid' would be used when referring to the ammunition supply for rifles and pistols."
