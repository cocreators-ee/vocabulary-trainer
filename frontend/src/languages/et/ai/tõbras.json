  "context": "The Estonian word 'tõbras' is a noun that primarily refers to an ox or cow, particularly an old one. It can also be used for other farm animals (domestic animals). In its second meaning, it's often used as a derogatory term for a brutish, loutish person with animal-like behavior. The word carries both literal and figurative connotations of being rough, uncouth, or behaving like an animal."
