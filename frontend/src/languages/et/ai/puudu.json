  "context": "The Estonian word 'puudu' is an adverb that indicates something or someone is insufficient, lacking, missing, or short of what is needed. It can be used to express when there isn't enough of something (money, people, time) or when something falls short of a requirement. The word appears in different contexts: 1) showing lack/deficiency of things ('tuli rahast puudu' - money was lacking), 2) indicating how much is needed for completion ('kümme minutit puudu' - ten minutes short), and 3) as an extension to the verb 'olema' (to be) meaning someone or something is not present where needed ('Peeter on puudu' - Peter is missing/absent)."
