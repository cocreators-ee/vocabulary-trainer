It's used to indicate absence or deficiency of something - whether it's a physical object, quality, quantity, or abstract concept. The word can be conjugated depending on the subject (like 'mul on puudu' for 'I lack', 'teel puudub' for 'you lack'). It's commonly used in everyday Estonian to express what someone needs or is missing."
