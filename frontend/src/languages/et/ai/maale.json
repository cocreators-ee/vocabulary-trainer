  "context": "The Estonian word 'maale' is an adverb meaning 'to the countryside' or 'to the country.' It indicates movement from a city or urban area toward rural regions. This word is commonly used when talking about going out of town, escaping to nature, or moving away from populated areas. The directional aspect is important - it specifically implies motion toward less developed or agricultural areas."
