  "context": "The word 'erinevat' is the partitive case singular form of the Estonian adjective 'erinev', which means 'different' or 'varying'. It's used to indicate that something has distinct characteristics, dissimilarity, or variety. In the dictionary definition provided, it's specifically used in relation to diacritical marks - letters that have different pronunciation from their standard form. The partitive case suggests we're talking about an amount or type of difference rather than a complete state of being different."
