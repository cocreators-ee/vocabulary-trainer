  "context": "The word 'sure' in Estonian is the root of the adjective 'surematu', which means immortal or eternal. It describes something that never dies or ceases to exist. This can refer to living beings (like immortals), concepts, works of art, or achievements that have lasting fame or significance. The word comes from the verb 'surema' (to die) and the negative suffix '-matu', literally meaning 'not-dying'. In Estonian grammar, this would be an adjective in the positive form when referring to something masculine/neuter singular, or plural when used with plural nouns."
