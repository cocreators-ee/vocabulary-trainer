  "context": "The Estonian word 'suuda' is a verb that means 'to be able to', 'can', or 'manage to do something'. It's the connegative form (used with negative particles like 'ei') of the verb 'suutma' which means 'to be able to' in its basic form. In English, we typically use modal verbs like 'can' or expressions like 'be able to' and 'manage to' to convey similar meaning. This word indicates capability or possibility."
