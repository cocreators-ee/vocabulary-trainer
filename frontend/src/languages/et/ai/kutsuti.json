  "context": "The word 'kutsuti' is the past tense passive form of the Estonian verb 'kutsuma', meaning 'to call' or 'to invite'. In this form, it indicates that someone was called, invited, or summoned in the past. The '-i' ending marks it as past tense and the absence of personal pronouns shows it's in passive voice."
