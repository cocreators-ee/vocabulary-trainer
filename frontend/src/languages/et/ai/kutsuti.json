  "context": "The word 'kutsuti' is the past tense form of the Estonian verb 'kutsuma', which means 'to invite' or 'to summon'. In this context, it functions as an adjective meaning 'invited' or 'summoned', and refers to a person who has been invited or summoned. The word can be used in different cases: here we see it in the partitive singular form (kutsutu), but it can also appear in other forms like the plural partitive (kutsutute). Examples show its usage referring to guests at an event, people responding to calls, and individuals selected for specific tasks."
