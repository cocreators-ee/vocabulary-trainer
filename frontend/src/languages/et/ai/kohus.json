  "context": "In Estonian, 'kohus' has two main meanings: 1) a court of law or tribunal where legal cases are heard and judgments are made, and 2) a duty, obligation, or responsibility that one has to fulfill. As a noun in nominative case, it can refer to either an institution (the court) or an abstract concept (duty/responsibility). In the legal context, it's used for judicial proceedings, while in everyday language, it often refers to moral or social obligations."
