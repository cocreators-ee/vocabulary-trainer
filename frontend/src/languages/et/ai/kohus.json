  "context": "The Estonian word 'kohus' has two main meanings: 1) A moral or internal obligation to fulfill certain responsibilities (similar to English 'duty' or 'obligation'), as in a son's duty to care for his sick mother. 2) A judicial court or tribunal of justice, similar to the English word 'court'. The declension pattern differs between these two meanings - when meaning 'duty', it follows the ÕS type 9/katus pattern (genitive: kohuste), while when meaning 'court', it follows the liige pattern (genitive: kohtu)."
