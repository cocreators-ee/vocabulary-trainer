  "context": "The phrase 'laiale teele' (literally 'onto a wide road/path') is an idiom in Estonian that means going astray, being led down the wrong path, or taking up a morally questionable lifestyle. It's often used to describe someone who has started making bad choices or living immorally, as if they've entered a broad but dangerous road with no boundaries. The metaphor suggests freedom from moral constraints but leads to negative consequences."
