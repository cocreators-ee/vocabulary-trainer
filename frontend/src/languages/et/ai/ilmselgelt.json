  "context": "The word 'ilmselgelt' is an Estonian adverb that means 'obviously', 'clearly', or 'evidently'. It's used to indicate that something is self-evident or apparent without needing further explanation. The word can be broken down as 'ilm-' (related to 'ilm' meaning world/surface) and '-selgelt' (meaning clearly/evidently), so literally it suggests something is clear on the surface."
