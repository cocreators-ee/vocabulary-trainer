  "context": "The Estonian word 'ilmselgelt' is an adverb that means obviously, clearly, or evidently. It indicates that something is so apparent or evident that it doesn't need to be explicitly stated. The word can be broken down as 'ilm-' (visible) and '-selgelt' (clearly), literally meaning 'clearly visible'. When used in a sentence, it emphasizes the obvious nature of a statement or observation."
