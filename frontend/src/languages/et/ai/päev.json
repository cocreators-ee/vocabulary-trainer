  "context": "The Estonian word 'päev' has multiple meanings including 1) the daylight period between sunrise and sunset, 2) a calendar day or 24-hour period, and 3) as a poetic term for the sun itself. It can refer to both the literal daytime hours and the concept of days in timekeeping. The word follows Estonian declension patterns with forms like päeva (genitive), päevad (plural nominative), etc."
