  "context": "The word 'surnuna' is the adessive case form of 'surnud' (dead) in Estonian. It's commonly used as an intensifier to express extreme exhaustion or fatigue, meaning someone feels so tired they feel dead or lifeless. This colloquial usage transforms the literal meaning of death into a metaphorical expression for being completely worn out."
