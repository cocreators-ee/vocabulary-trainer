  "context": "The word 'surnuna' in Estonian is an adverbial form that means 'with feet forward' or 'feet first'. It describes the manner of movement where someone moves with their legs leading, rather than head first. This can be used literally for physical movements like crawling, diving, or entering a space feet first, and figuratively to describe doing something in a particular manner without hesitation."
