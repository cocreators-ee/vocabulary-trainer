  "context": "The Estonian word 'ümber' is a versatile preposition/postposition/adverb with multiple meanings. As an adverb, it means 'around' (turn around), 'over' (fall over), or 'upside down'. As a preposition/postposition governing the genitive case, it can mean 'around' (something surrounding something else), 'on the perimeter', 'all over', or 'across'. It's used to describe circular movement, positioning around something, being surrounded by something, changing direction or position, and sometimes indicates approximate quantities or temporal references."
