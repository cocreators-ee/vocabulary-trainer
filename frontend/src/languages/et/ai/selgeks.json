  "context": "The Estonian word 'selgeks' is the elative case form of 'selge', meaning 'from clear' or 'becoming clear'. It often indicates a process of clarification, completion, or understanding. The '-ks' ending transforms it into an illative-like form suggesting movement toward clarity or the result of becoming clear."
