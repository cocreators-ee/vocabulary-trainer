  "context": "The word 'vanematele' is the allative case of 'vanemad', which means 'parents'. In Estonian, the allative case (-le ending) indicates movement towards or direction to something/someone. So 'vanematele' specifically means 'to parents' or 'for parents' - indicating that something is directed toward, intended for, or going to the parents. This form is commonly used when talking about things given to, said to, or happening for parents."
