  "context": "The Estonian word 'huvitatud' is the past participle form of the verb 'huvi tulla' (to become interested) and means 'interested'. It describes someone who has developed an interest or curiosity about something. The word can be used with various subjects (mina, sina, ta, meie, teie, nemad) to indicate different people being interested in something. In Estonian grammar, this form is commonly used as a predicate adjective after the verb 'olema' (to be)."
