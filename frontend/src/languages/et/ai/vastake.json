  "context": "The word 'vastake' is the second person plural imperative form of the Estonian verb 'vasta', which means 'to respond, answer, or reply'. It's used when addressing multiple people and telling them to give a response. The singular form would be 'vasta' (addressing one person), and other forms include 'vastan' (I answer) and 'vabavad' (they answer). This verb is commonly used in both formal and informal contexts when asking someone or a group of people to provide an answer or reaction."
