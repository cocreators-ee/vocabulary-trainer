  "context": "The word 'aastake' is an Estonian colloquial term meaning 'a little while' or 'a short time'. It's formed from 'aasta' (year) with the diminutive suffix '-ke', making it literally mean 'little year' but functionally equivalent to expressions like 'a little while' in English. The word is often used informally and expresses a relatively brief period of time, much shorter than a full year."
