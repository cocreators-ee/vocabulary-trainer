  "context": "The word 'arreteeritud' is the Estonian past participle form of the verb 'arreteerima', which means 'to arrest'. It describes someone who has been arrested or apprehended by authorities. The '-tud' suffix in Estonian indicates that this is a passive voice construction, meaning the person has had the action done to them rather than performing it themselves."
