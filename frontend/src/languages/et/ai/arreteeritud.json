  "context": "The word 'arreteeritud' comes from the Estonian verb 'kinni kukkuma' which means to fall in, get caught, or be arrested. It is used to describe someone who has been apprehended by authorities and taken into custody. The word appears to be derived from French 'arrêter' (to arrest) through borrowing."
