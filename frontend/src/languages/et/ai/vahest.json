  "context": "The Estonian word 'vahest' is an adverb that can have multiple meanings depending on context. It most commonly means 'sometimes' when indicating occasional occurrence, but it can also mean 'perhaps' or 'maybe' when expressing uncertainty or possibility. This flexibility makes it useful for various situations where you want to express either infrequent occurrence or tentative suggestion."
