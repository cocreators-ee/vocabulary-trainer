  "context": "The Estonian verb 'astuma' means to take a step or enter. It can be used when climbing stairs, entering a room, or taking steps forward. The word changes form depending on the subject and tense - 'astun' (I step), 'astud' (you step), 'astub' (he/she/it steps), 'astume' (we step), 'astute' (you plural step), 'avad' (they step). In past tense it becomes 'astus'. It's commonly used for both literal stepping and entering spaces."
