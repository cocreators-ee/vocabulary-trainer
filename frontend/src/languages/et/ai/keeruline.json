  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'keeruline' describes something that is complex, complicated, or difficult. It can refer to physical structures with many twists and turns (like a braided palmik), as well as abstract concepts like processes, situations, tasks, problems, or questions that are hard to understand or accomplish. The word often contrasts with 'lihtne' (simple) in Estonian."
