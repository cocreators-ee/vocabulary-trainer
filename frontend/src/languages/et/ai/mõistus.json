  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõistus' primarily refers to the human ability to think logically, reason, understand things, and exercise good judgment. It encompasses intellectual capacity, common sense, and rational thinking. The word can be used in various contexts - from describing someone's intelligence level ('terase mõistusega poiss' - boy with sharp intellect) to referring to common sense ('terve mõistus' - sound/common sense). In some cases it may even mean 'consciousness' or 'awareness'. It's a fundamental concept in Estonian culture that represents the cognitive faculty distinguishing humans from animals."
