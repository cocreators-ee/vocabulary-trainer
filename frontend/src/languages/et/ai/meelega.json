  "context": "The Estonian word 'meelega' is an adverb that indicates willingness, voluntary action, or happiness in doing something. It's formed from the noun 'meel' (mind/will) with the '-ga' suffix meaning 'with', so literally it means 'with will/mind'. The word expresses that someone does something willingly and cheerfully rather than being forced to do it."
