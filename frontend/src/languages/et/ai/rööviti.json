  "context": "The word 'rööviti' is the past tense of the Estonian verb 'röövima', which means to rob, steal, or kidnap. In this specific dictionary entry context, it appears in an archaic usage referring to abducting women for marriage, as mentioned in the phrase 'vanasti rööviti, tõmmati naine' (in olden times, they abducted/were robbed away a woman). The word indicates that something was taken forcefully or stolen, often with connotations of violence and abduction."
