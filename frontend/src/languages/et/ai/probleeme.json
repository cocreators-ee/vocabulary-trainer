  "context": "The word 'probleeme' is the partitive plural form of 'probleem' in Estonian. It means 'problems' or 'issues' in English. This is commonly used when referring to multiple problems that exist, similar to how we might say 'we have some problems' or 'there are many issues'. The partitive case in Estonian is often used with plural nouns to indicate an indefinite quantity or incomplete action."
