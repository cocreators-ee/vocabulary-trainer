  "context": "The word 'teaks' is the conditional mood (conditional I) form of the Estonian verb 'tema' meaning 'to know'. It's used in hypothetical or uncertain situations, similar to how we use 'would know', 'might know', or 'could know' in English. This form indicates a possibility rather than certainty about someone knowing something."
