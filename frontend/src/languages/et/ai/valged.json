  "context": "The word 'valged' is the plural nominative form of the adjective 'valge' meaning 'white' in Estonian. It describes multiple objects that are white in color. The '-d' ending indicates it's in plural form, and since there's no case marker after this, it's in nominative case (the basic dictionary form)."
