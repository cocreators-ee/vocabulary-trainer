  "context": "The Estonian word 'millise' is the illative case form of 'milline', meaning 'what kind of' or 'which type of'. It's used to ask about the quality, type, or category of something. In Estonian grammar, the illative case indicates movement into a place or, in this context, selection from a group. When asking questions about what kind of things someone has, wants, or is experiencing, 'millise' would be appropriate."
