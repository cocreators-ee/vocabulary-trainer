  "context": "The Estonian word 'üks' means 'one' or 'a/an'. It's used as both the number one and as an indefinite article before singular nouns. In the given text 'unes', this appears to be a typo of 'üks' where the letter 's' has been added. The correct form would be 'üks', meaning 'one' or 'an/a single'."
