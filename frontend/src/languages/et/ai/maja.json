  "context": "The Estonian word 'maja' primarily means 'house' or 'building'. It can refer to a physical structure used for living, working, or providing services. In its most common usage, it denotes a residential house or building. The word is declined in various cases depending on grammatical function (e.g., majas = in the house, majast = from the house). It also appears in numerous compound words where it specifies the type of building, such as elumaja (residential house), koolimaja (school building), or rahvamaja (community center)."
