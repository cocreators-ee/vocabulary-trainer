  "context": "The word 'poolt' in Estonian is used as an adverbial expression meaning 'from one's own side' or 'on someone's behalf'. It often appears with the genitive form of the possessive pronoun oma ('own') to indicate that something is done by a person personally, from their own initiative, or representing themselves. The expression omalt poolt emphasizes personal participation or contribution in an action, sometimes with a contrastive meaning when compared to others' actions."
