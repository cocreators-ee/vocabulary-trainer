  "context": "In Estonian, 'hind' is a noun that means price or cost. It's used to refer to the amount of money something costs. For example: 'Hind on 10 eurot' means 'The price is 10 euros'. The word can appear in different contexts such as comparing prices ('K천rge hind ei t채henda alati head kvaliteeti' - 'High price doesn't always mean good quality') or asking about what's included in a price ('Mida see hind sisaldab?' - 'What does this price include?')."
