  "context": "In Estonian, 'hind' primarily means price or cost - the monetary value paid for goods or services. It can also refer to the value or worth of something, and in some contexts means a penalty or what one has to sacrifice for something else. The word appears in many compound terms related to different types of pricing (market price, wholesale price, etc.) and is commonly used in everyday transactions and economic discussions."
