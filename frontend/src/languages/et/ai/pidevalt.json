  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'pidevalt' means continuously, constantly or without interruption. It describes something that happens regularly or persists over time without stopping. In the first dictionary definition, it indicates continuous action (like a volcano not acting continuously), persistent presence (wind blowing from the east constantly), or ongoing processes (groundwater resources renewing continuously). The second mathematical/physics definition uses it to mean gradually or smoothly changing quantities."
