  "context": "The word 'lahkuvad' is the 3rd person plural present form of the verb 'lahkuma', meaning to leave or depart. In this zoological context, it specifically refers to birds whose young leave the nest shortly after hatching from their eggs. These are called 'nest-leavers' or 'precocial' birds in English. The term describes a developmental strategy where chicks are fully developed at hatching and can leave the nest immediately rather than remaining altricial (helpless)."
