  "context": "The word 'tulistage' is the second person plural imperative form of the verb 'tulista', which means 'to shoot'. It's a command or instruction telling multiple people to shoot. This form is used when addressing a group of people informally (using 'te' as the informal plural pronoun). The root 'tuli-' relates to fire/weaponry, and '-stage' is the imperative ending for second person plural verbs in Estonian."
