  "context": "The word 'kallal' is the adessive case form of 'kallas', which means 'shore' or 'bank' (of a river, lake, etc.). In this case, it appears to be used as an adjective meaning 'on top of' or 'above'. The adessive case in Estonian typically indicates location on something or being near something."
