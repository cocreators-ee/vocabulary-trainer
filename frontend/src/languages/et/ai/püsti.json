  "context": "In Estonian, 'püsti' is an adverb that means upright or straight. It describes the position of something standing vertically without bending or leaning. For example, when someone stands up straight from sitting down, you could say they stood 'püsti'. It can also refer to things positioned vertically rather than horizontally."
