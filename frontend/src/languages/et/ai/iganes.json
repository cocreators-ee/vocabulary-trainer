  "context": "The Estonian word 'iganes' is a versatile adverb with two main meanings. First, it can mean 'whatever,' 'any,' or 'ever' when used to emphasize that someone can do anything they want or go anywhere they desire. Second, in negative sentences, it means 'never' or 'not any.' The dictionary definitions show examples like 'Teeb, mis ta iganes tahab' (He does whatever he wants) and 'Sellist asja pole iganes kuuldud' (Such a thing has never been heard). The word can be used in various contexts to express complete freedom of choice or absence entirely."
