  "context": "The word 'noormees' is an Estonian noun meaning 'young man'. It's composed of two parts: 'noor' (young) and 'mees' (man). The term specifically refers to a young adult male, often in the context of being unmarried or still considered youthful. In different contexts, it can also imply a bachelor or a youth who is coming of age. The word changes form depending on case - as shown in the examples: 'noormees' (nominative), 'noormehed' (plural nominative), and 'noormehena' (essive/instrumental case)."
