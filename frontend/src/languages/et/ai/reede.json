  "context": "The Estonian word 'reede' means Friday, which is the fifth day of the week in Estonia. It follows Thursday (neljapäev) and precedes Saturday (laupäev). The word comes from Old Swedish 'frē(a)dagher', ultimately from Proto-West Germanic '*Frījā dag' meaning 'day of Frigg'. There are special references to certain Fridays like 'Suur reede' (Good Friday) which is the Friday before Easter, and some people consider a Friday that falls on the 13th day of the month to be particularly unlucky."
