  "context": "The Estonian verb 'ravida' means to heal, treat, cure, or care for someone who is ill. It can refer to medical treatment of diseases and conditions, either by professionals or self-care. The word has two main senses: 1) using medications or treatments to restore health or stop disease processes (healing/treating), and 2) to take care of or groom something (as in 'ravitud küüned' meaning cared-for nails)."
