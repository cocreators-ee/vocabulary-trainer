  "context": "The Estonian word 'surmani' is a postposition or adverb that means 'until death' or 'to the end of one's life'. It is formed from the root word 'surnud' (dead) combined with the suffix '-ni', which indicates duration or direction up to a point. This word expresses the concept of continuing something for one's entire lifetime, emphasizing permanence and lifelong commitment."
