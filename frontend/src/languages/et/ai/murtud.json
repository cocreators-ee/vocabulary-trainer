  "context": "In Estonian, 'murtud' is an adjective that means 'broken'. In musical context, it specifically refers to a broken chord or arpeggio where the individual notes of a chord are played in succession rather than simultaneously. The word can also be used more generally to describe something that is fractured, shattered, or broken."
