  "context": "The Estonian word 'murtud' is the past participle form of the verb 'murda', meaning 'to break'. It describes something that has been broken, fractured, or cracked. This can refer to physical objects (like glass, toys), body parts (broken bones), or abstract concepts (broken heart). The adjective form agrees with the noun it modifies in gender and number."
