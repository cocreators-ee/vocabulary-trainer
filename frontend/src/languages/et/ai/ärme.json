  "context": "The word 'ärme' is the plural nominative form of Estonian noun 'ärm', which means 'arm'. It can refer to a person's arms or sleeves of clothing. In Estonian, like other Finno-Ugric languages, nouns have different cases and numbers. This is the plural form used when talking about multiple arms or sleeves in the subject position of a sentence."
