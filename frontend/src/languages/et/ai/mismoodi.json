  "context": "The Estonian word 'mismoodi' is an interrogative adverb used to ask about the manner or way something is done. It combines 'mis' (what) with 'moodi' (way/manner) and functions similarly to English 'how' or 'in what way'. It's commonly used in questions seeking information about methods, processes, or ways of doing things."
