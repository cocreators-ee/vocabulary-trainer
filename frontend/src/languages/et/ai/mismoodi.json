  "context": "The Estonian word 'mismoodi' is an interrogative adverb used to ask about manner or method. It functions similarly to English words like 'how', 'in what way', or 'by what means'. The word can be used in direct questions asking for specific information, in rhetorical expressions showing surprise or disbelief, and to introduce subordinate clauses describing methods or manners. It's commonly used at the beginning of both direct and indirect questions when seeking details about how something was done or happened."
