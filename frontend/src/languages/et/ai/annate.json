  "context": "The word 'annate' is the second-person plural present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'andma', which means 'to give'. It specifically addresses multiple people (plural) in a formal or polite way ('te'), and it indicates an ongoing action (present tense). In English, this would correspond to phrases like 'you give', 'you provide', or 'you offer' when addressing more than one person politely."
