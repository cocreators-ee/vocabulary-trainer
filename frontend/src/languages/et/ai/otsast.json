  "context": "\"Otsast\" is an Estonian postposition and adverb that indicates starting from, off from, or coming down from the top, end, or side of something. It can be used with various cases (genitive) to show origin point or direction. For example, when something falls \"kapi otsast\" it means it fell \"off the cupboard/top of the cupboard.\" The word relates to \"ots\" meaning end or tip, and adding \"-st\" indicates a starting point or separation from that end."
