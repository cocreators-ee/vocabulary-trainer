  "context": "The word 'loe' in Estonian primarily means 'northwest', referring to the compass point between north and west. It can be used as a noun indicating the northwest direction, or it can function as part of compound words like 'loodes' (to the northwest), 'loodesse' (into the northwest). Additionally, 'loe' has another meaning as the imperative form of the verb 'lugema' (to read) and its present connegative form."
