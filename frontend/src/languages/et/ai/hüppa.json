  "context": "The word 'hüppa' is the basic form of an Estonian verb meaning 'to jump'. It's used to describe the action of jumping, leaping, or hopping. In the dictionary definitions provided, there seems to be some confusion as 'hukutama' (meaning 'to drown' or 'to destroy') appears instead of 'hüppa', but based on the context and common Estonian vocabulary, 'hüppa' clearly means 'to jump'. It's an infinitive verb form that would be used in commands or basic statements about jumping actions."
