  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaid' is a versatile adverb that primarily means 'only', 'just', 'merely', or 'solely'. It can be used in several contexts: 1) to limit something to just the mentioned amount (e.g., having only 25 krooni left); 2) to indicate exclusivity (talking only to you); and 3) in comparative constructions with negation where it introduces a contrastive element. 'Vaid' often emphasizes limitation or exclusivity, indicating that nothing else is included beyond what has been mentioned."
