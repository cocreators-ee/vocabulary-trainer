  "context": "The Estonian word 'viirus' has two main meanings. In biology, it refers to an extremely small pathogen without cellular structure that reproduces only in living cells (similar to English 'virus'). In computing, it specifically means a computer virus - a harmful program that damages software and data and can self-replicate in computer systems. The word can be used both for biological viruses causing diseases like hepatitis or flu-like illnesses, and for malicious computer programs that spread through networks."
