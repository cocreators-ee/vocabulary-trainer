  "context": "The word 'temasse' is the illative case form of the Estonian pronoun 'tema', meaning 'him/her/it'. The illative case indicates movement into or towards something, so 'temasse' means 'into him/her/it' or 'towards him/her/it'. This form would typically be used after verbs expressing motion or direction towards a person. In Estonian grammar, the illative case answers the question 'kuhu?' (where to?)."
