  "context": "The Estonian word 'etendus' refers to a show or performance of any kind, such as a play, dance, musical number, circus act, or other entertainment presented to an audience. It can be used for scheduled performances like matinee shows and evening performances, and indicates that something is in progress when the speaker arrives late (e.g., 'etendus juba käib' - the show is already in progress). The word has various compound forms such as teatrietendus (theater performance), balletietendus (ballet performance), etc."
