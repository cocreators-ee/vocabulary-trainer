  "context": "The word 'suudad' is the second-person singular present indicative form of the Estonian verb 'suda', which means 'to kiss'. This form would be used when addressing someone informally (using 'you') to tell them what they are doing in the present moment. For example, if you're telling a friend or family member to kiss you right now, you would say 'Tule suudad mind kohe!' meaning 'Come kiss me right now!'. The verb is commonly used for romantic kissing."
