  "context": "The word 'tulnukad' in Estonian has two main meanings. First, it refers to immigrants or newcomers - people who have arrived in a place and are not originally from there, often used to describe tensions between indigenous populations and recent arrivals. Second, it can refer to extraterrestrials or aliens from other worlds. The word is the plural form of 'tulnuk' and carries connotations of being foreign or recently arrived."
