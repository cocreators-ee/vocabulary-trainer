  "context": "The word 'saan' in Estonian has two distinct meanings. As a noun, it refers to a sleigh (a winter vehicle with runners pulled by animals). As a verb form, it is the first-person singular present indicative of 'saama', meaning 'I can' or 'I get'. The dictionary definition primarily focuses on the noun usage, referring specifically to a lightweight winter sled-like vehicle that moves on runners. This type of sleigh was commonly used for transportation in snowy conditions during winter months."
