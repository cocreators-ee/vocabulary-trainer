  "context": "Vaatame is the 1st person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb 'vaadata', which means 'to look' or 'to watch'. In this form, it translates to 'we are looking/watching'. The dictionary definition shows that this word appears in a context where people are watching and observing something, specifically in the sentence 'Me sõidame ja vaatame teele, mis tormab meile vastu ja kaob me alt' (We travel and watch the road that rushes toward us and disappears from under us)."
