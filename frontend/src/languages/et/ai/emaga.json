  "context": "The word 'emaga' is an Estonian noun case form that means 'with mother/mom'. It's the comitative case (koosütlev kääne) of 'ema' meaning mother, and the suffix '-ga' indicates accompaniment or association - showing doing something together with someone. The word follows the pattern where 'ema' becomes 'emaga' when you want to express that an action is done together with one's mother."
