  "context": "The word 'emaga' is an Estonian adessive case form that means 'with mother' or 'in the company of mother.' It comes from the root word 'ema' (mother) and the '-ga' suffix which indicates accompaniment or association. This construction follows typical Estonian grammar where the adessive case shows location in proximity to something, but can also indicate possession or accompaniment."
