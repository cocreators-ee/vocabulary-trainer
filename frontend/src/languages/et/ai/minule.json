  "context": "The Estonian word 'minule' is a dative case form of the pronoun 'mina', meaning 'I/me'. In Estonian grammar, the dative case indicates the indirect object or direction toward someone. So 'minule' specifically means 'to me' or 'for me', indicating that something is given to, done for, or directed toward the speaker. It's commonly used when receiving things, directions being given to you, or when expressing that something benefits or affects you."
