  "context": "In Estonian, 'magan' is the partitive form of the word 'magama' (to sleep). It means 'lying down' or 'asleep'. The dictionary shows it's commonly used to describe someone who has thrown themselves down or collapsed into a lying position. It can be used both for people going to sleep and for people falling or being knocked down. In different contexts, it might refer to sleeping in bed ('pikali voodisse põdema' - lying down to sleep) or simply being in a prone/lying position."
