  "context": "In Estonian, 'v천im' is a noun that refers to power, authority, or control. It can be used in political contexts to refer to governmental power, in personal relationships to denote authority over someone, or more generally to describe capability or strength. The word has cognates in other Finno-Ugric languages and comes from the same root as Finnish 'voima' meaning strength or might."
