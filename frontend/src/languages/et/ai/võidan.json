  "context": "The Estonian word 'võidan' is the first person singular present tense form of the verb 'võima', which means both 'to win' and 'to be able to/can'. This dual meaning exists in several languages including English where 'win' and 'can/be able to' are distinct words. In Estonian, the same root form can express both concepts depending on context."
