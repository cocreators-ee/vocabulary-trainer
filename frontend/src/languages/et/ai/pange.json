  "context": "The word 'pange' is the plural imperative form of the verb 'panema'. It means 'put, place, take' but in this specific context with 'pahaks', it means 'take offense' or 'take amiss'. The phrase 'pane pahaks' literally means 'put as bad/wrong' and is used when someone feels offended by something another person said or did. In the given example sentence 'Võtke heaks või pange pahaks', it's paired with 'võta heaks' (take well/good) suggesting that listeners should either accept what was said well or take offense to it."
