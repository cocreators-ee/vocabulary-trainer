  "context": "The Estonian word 'toit' means food or nourishment. It refers to substances that provide nutrition for living organisms, both in the general sense of sustenance and in the specific sense of meals or dishes. The word can be used for human food as well as animal feed. In its basic form 'toit', it's a singular noun, but it has various declensions including genitive 'toidu' (of food), partitive 'toitu' (some food), and plural 'toidud' (foods/meals). The word is very versatile in Estonian, used to describe everything from basic human sustenance to specific types of meals and even metaphorical nourishment like intellectual or spiritual food."
