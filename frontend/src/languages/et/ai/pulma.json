  "context": "The word 'pulma' in Estonian is the genitive singular, partitive singular, and illative singular form of the noun 'pulm'. Based on the dictionary definitions, it primarily refers to a wedding reception or after-wedding party that takes place about a week after the main wedding ceremony. This celebration was traditionally held for the closest relatives who could not attend the main wedding (pulm). It's an important social event in Estonian wedding traditions."
