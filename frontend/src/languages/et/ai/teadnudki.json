  "context": "The word 'teadnudki' is a compound form in Estonian combining the past tense participle 'teanud' (known) with the particle 'ki'. The 'ki' adds emphasis and can be translated as 'even', 'at all', or actually depending on context. It suggests that knowing something was noteworthy or unexpected. In English, this would correspond to constructions like 'even knew', 'knew at all', or 'actually knew' when emphasizing the fact of knowing something."
