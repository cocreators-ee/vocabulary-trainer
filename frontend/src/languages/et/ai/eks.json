  "context": "In Estonian, 'eks' is a versatile discourse particle that functions as an affirmation or agreement word. It can express consent ('yes'), confirmation ('indeed'), mild emphasis ('really'), or serve as a response to questions where the expected answer is affirmative. The word often appears at the beginning of sentences and carries various nuances including slight surprise, insistence, or simple acknowledgment."
