  "context": "The Estonian word 'eks' is an adverb that expresses certainty or obviousness. It's used to emphasize the truth of a statement, similar to saying 'of course', 'really', or 'obviously' in English. This word often appears at the beginning of sentences and reinforces that what follows is considered self-evident or unquestionably true."
