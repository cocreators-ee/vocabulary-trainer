  "context": "The word 'meetrit' is the partitive case singular form of 'meeter', which means 'meter' (the unit of length measurement). In Estonian, when you're talking about a quantity or amount of meters that isn't specified as a whole number, you use the partitive case. For example, '체heksa meetrit' means nine meters (but could be interpreted as approximately nine meters or some unspecified amount of meters)."
