  "context": "The Estonian word 'meetrit' is the partitive case form of 'meeter', which means 'meter'. It's used when referring to a quantity or measurement of meters, similar to how we say '5 meters' in English. The partitive case indicates that we're talking about an unspecified amount or partial unit of something."
