  "context": "The word 'iialgi' is an Estonian adverb that means 'never' or 'not ever'. It is used in negative sentences to indicate that something will never happen or has never happened. The word can also express the idea of 'under no circumstances' or 'at no time'. In the examples, it's used to emphasize that someone doesn't have time (Tal pole iialgi aeda - He/she never has time), that nobody would have believed something (Keegi poleks iialgi uskunud...), and as an emphatic negative in a statement about a girl not going somewhere (Tüdruk ei lähe sinna, ei iialgi!)."
