  "context": "The Estonian word 'iialgi' is an adverb that means 'never' or 'not ever'. It's used to express that something has not happened at any time in the past and will not happen in the future. This word combines 'iial' (ever) with '-gi' (also/either), but functions as a single negative temporal adverb in Estonian."
