  "context": "The word 'lukku' in Estonian is an illative case form of the noun 'lukk', which means a lock or latch. The illative case indicates movement into or towards something, so 'lukku' specifically refers to 'into the lock' or 'to the lock'. It's used when referring to putting something into a lock position or moving toward a lock. This is different from the nominative form 'lukk' which simply means 'lock' as in an object."
