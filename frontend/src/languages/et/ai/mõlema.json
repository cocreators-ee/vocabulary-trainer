  "context": "The word 'mõlema' is the partitive case of 'mõlemad' which means 'both'. It's used with singular nouns to indicate that two items or people are being referred to. In Estonian, when you want to say 'of both' or refer to something concerning two entities in a way that implies they're considered together as a pair, you use this form. For example, 'mõlema poole peal' means 'on both sides'."
