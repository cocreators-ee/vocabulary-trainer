  "context": "Mõlema is an Estonian word meaning 'both' or 'the two'. It's a determinative pronoun that refers to two people or objects as belonging together. The word has different forms depending on its grammatical case: mõlema (genitive), mõlemat (partitive), mõlemad (nominative plural). When used substantively, it can function as both singular and plural, while when used adjectivally, it's typically singular except in the nominative case where there is no singular form. Examples include 'Poeg ja tütar tulid mõlema pühadeks koju' (The son and daughter came home for holidays together) and 'Võttis mu mõlemast käest kinni' (He held me by both hands)."
