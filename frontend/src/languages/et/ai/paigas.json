  "context": "The word 'paigas' is an Estonian adverb that means 'in place' or 'stationary'. It's formed from the noun 'koht' (place) with the positional suffix '-as', and it indicates something or someone remaining in a fixed position without movement. In English, this corresponds to concepts like 'staying put,' 'remaining stationary,' or 'not moving.'"
