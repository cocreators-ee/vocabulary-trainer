  "context": "The word 'onju' (also spelled as 'onku') in Estonian has two main meanings: 1) It can refer to any male adult who is not a close family member, similar to calling someone 'uncle' even if they're not actually related. This usage appears to be common when addressing children or informally referring to other men. 2) It can also mean some stranger or foreign man, sometimes used ironically to refer to a good/nice man. The word seems to have an affectionate or informal connotation and is often used in familiar speech patterns."
