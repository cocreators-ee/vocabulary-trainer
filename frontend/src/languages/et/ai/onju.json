  "context": "The word 'onju' is an Estonian adverb that expresses agreement or affirmation. It's used to confirm something as true or correct, similar to English words like 'indeed', 'truly', or 'really'. The word appears to be a combination of 'on' (is) and '-ju' (a particle indicating affirmation), making it literally mean something like 'it is so'. It can stand alone in response or be used within sentences to emphasize the truthfulness of a statement."
