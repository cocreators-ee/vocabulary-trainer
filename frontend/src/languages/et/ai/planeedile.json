  "context": "The word 'planeedile' is an Estonian word that functions as a positional case form, specifically the illative case. It indicates movement toward or destination at a planet. The base word is 'planeet' (planet), and the '-le' suffix transforms it into the illative case meaning 'to/into/toward the planet'. This case is used to express motion towards something."
