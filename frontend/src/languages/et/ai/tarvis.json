  "context": "The Estonian word 'tarvis' is a versatile postposition (when used with genitive case) and adverb that indicates necessity, requirement, or purpose. As a postposition, it means 'for', 'for the sake of', or needed for someone's use or for some purpose (e.g., 'pere tarvis' = 'for the family'). As an adverb, it means 'necessary', 'needed', or 'required' when used with verbs to indicate that something is required (e.g., 'on tarvis minna' = 'it is necessary to go'). It can also be used in elliptical constructions where it stands alone as a complete expression of need."
