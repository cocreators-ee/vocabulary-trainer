  "context": "The word 'orki' is an Estonian adverb meaning 'into a trap' or 'into trouble'. It's used to describe falling into difficulties, getting trapped in a bad situation, or becoming ruined. The word often appears with verbs like 'kukkuma' (to fall), 'lendama' (to fly/go), and 'minema' (to go). For example, when someone falls victim to scams or gets into unfortunate circumstances, Estonians might say they went 'orki'."
