  "context": "The word 'osas' is the inessive singular form of the Estonian noun 'osa'. It can mean a physical part or component of something, a section or division of a whole, a share or portion allocated to someone, a role or function (especially in performances), or an aspect regarding something. The inessive case indicates location within something ('in' or 'on'), so 'osas' typically means 'in a part', 'in a portion', or 'regarding/as for a part/port/share'."
