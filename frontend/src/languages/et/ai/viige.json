  "context": "The word 'viige' in Estonian is not a standard Estonian word. It appears to be either a misspelling of the word 'viiage' (which means 'guide' or 'instructor') or potentially a loanword from another language. In context, it seems to refer to a person who guides or teaches others, similar to an instructor or tutor."
