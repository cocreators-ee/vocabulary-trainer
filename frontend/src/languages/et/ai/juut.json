  "context": "The Estonian word 'juut' means 'Jew', referring to a person belonging to the Jewish people or religion. It can be used ethnically or religiously and refers to descendants of the ancient Hebrew people who are now widely distributed across many countries. The dictionary also notes that in colloquial usage, it can sometimes refer to someone with shrewd business acumen (similar to English expressions like 'smart businessman'). In literature, it's been used with negative connotations to describe stingy or cunning merchants, though this usage is dated and potentially offensive."
