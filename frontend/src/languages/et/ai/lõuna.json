  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõuna' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can mean 'south' as a direction (e.g., 'Lõuna-Aafrika' for South Africa), it can refer to the southern part of something, and it also means 'noon' or midday when referring to time. The word changes form in different cases - 'lõunasse' would be 'to the south', 'lõunal' means 'at noon'. This is a common Estonian word with both directional and temporal meanings."
