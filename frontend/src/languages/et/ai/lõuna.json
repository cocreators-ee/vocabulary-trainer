  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõuna' is a versatile term with three main meanings: 1) south (as in compass direction), 2) midday or noon, and 3) lunch or the main meal of the day. This makes it somewhat similar to Finnish 'lounas', though their meanings differ slightly - Estonian 'lõuna' doesn't include southwest like Finnish does. The word can be declined in various cases depending on its usage: nominative lõuna, genitive lõunate, partitive lõunat, illative lõunasse, etc."
