  "context": "Üsna is an Estonian adverb used to indicate a moderate degree or extent. It corresponds to English words like 'quite', 'rather', 'fairly', or 'reasonably'. The word can be used in two main senses: 1) as an intensifier meaning 'to some degree' or 'moderately' (similar to 'quite/rather'), and 2) occasionally with a stronger meaning similar to 'completely' or 'totally'. From the dictionary data, it appears to have originated from an old plural form of üks ('one')."
