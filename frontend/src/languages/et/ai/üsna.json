  "context": "The Estonian word 'üsna' is an adverb used to indicate a moderate or medium degree of something. It's similar in meaning and usage to English words like 'quite', 'rather', or 'fairly'. It often expresses that something is more than just average but not extremely so - it occupies a middle ground between minimal and maximum intensity. For example, 'töö on üsna raske' means the work is quite difficult (not impossible, but definitely challenging)."
