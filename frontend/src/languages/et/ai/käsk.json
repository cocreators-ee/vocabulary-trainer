  "context": "In Estonian, 'käsk' means a command or order that must be followed without objection. It can refer to verbal or written instructions given by authority figures like commanders, teachers, parents, rulers, etc. The word has several grammatical forms including käsu (genitive), käsku (partitive), käsud (plural nominative), and käske (accusative/partitive plural). In religious contexts, it refers to the Ten Commandments. Modern usage also includes computing where a käsk can be an instruction that activates or stops operations from user input or files."
