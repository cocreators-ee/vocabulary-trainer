  "context": "The word 'akna' is the genitive singular form of the Estonian noun 'aken', which means 'window'. In Estonian grammar, the genitive case indicates possession or relationship, so 'akna' literally translates to 'window's' or 'belonging to/window of something'. This form would be used when you want to express that something belongs to a window or is related to it in some way."
