  "context": "The word 'akna' is the nominative singular form of a noun meaning window in Estonian. It refers to an opening in a wall or door that allows light and air to enter, typically with glass panes. In Estonian grammar, nouns change their endings based on case (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.) and number (singular/plural). 'Akna' would become 'akna' in genitive singular, 'aknat' in partitive singular, 'aknad' in nominative plural, etc."
