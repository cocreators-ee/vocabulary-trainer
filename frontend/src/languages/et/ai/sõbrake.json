  "context": "'Sõbrake' is a diminutive form of the Estonian word 'sõber', which means 'friend'. The suffix '-ke' makes it a small or affectionate form, similar to adding '-let' or '-ie' in English. It's used to refer to a friend endearingly, particularly someone younger or dearer. In some contexts, it can also be used romantically between close partners. The word carries connotations of affection and closeness."
