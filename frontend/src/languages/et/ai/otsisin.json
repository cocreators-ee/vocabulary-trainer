  "context": "The word 'otsisin' is the first person singular past tense form of the Estonian verb 'otsima', which means 'to search for' or 'to look for'. In the example sentences, it appears in contexts where someone was searching for something specific. The dictionary definitions show that 'eeli' (preposition) and 'eel' (adverb) both relate to temporal priority - meaning 'before' in time. However, the word 'otsisin' specifically refers to the action of searching or looking for something."
