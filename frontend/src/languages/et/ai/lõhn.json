  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõhn' is a noun that refers to a smell or scent. It can be used for pleasant smells (like fragrances) as well as unpleasant ones (like odors). The word doesn't change form in these examples, but in Estonian grammar it would decline depending on its role in the sentence - nominative case shown here, with plural form 'lõhnad' meaning 'smells'. It's a common everyday word used to describe various olfactory experiences."
