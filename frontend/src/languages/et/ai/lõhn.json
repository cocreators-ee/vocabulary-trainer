  "context": "The Estonian word 'lõhn' primarily refers to a smell, scent, fragrance or odour that can be perceived through the sense of smell. It can describe pleasant scents like flowers or coffee as well as unpleasant ones. In its plural form 'lõhnad', it specifically often refers to the smell of alcohol on someone's breath, suggesting they've been drinking. The word can also metaphorically refer to a subtle quality or feature that suggests something about a person or situation."
