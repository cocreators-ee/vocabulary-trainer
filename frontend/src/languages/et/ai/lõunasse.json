  "context": "\"Lõunasse\" is an Estonian directional adverb meaning \"southward\" or \"to the south.\" It indicates movement toward the southern direction. The word is formed from \"lõuna\" (south) with the illative case ending \"-sse\" which indicates motion into or toward a place. This construction follows the pattern of many Estonian directional words where the basic word for a cardinal direction is combined with the illative suffix to indicate movement in that direction."
