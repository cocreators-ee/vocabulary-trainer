  "context": "The Estonian word 'iga' primarily means 'age' or 'lifetime'. It can refer to a person's age, the duration of something's existence, or an era/period in history. The word has different forms depending on grammatical case - for example, it appears as 'ea' in the genitive case and 'igas' in the inessive case. When talking about age groups, compounds like 'keskiga' (middle age) are commonly formed."
