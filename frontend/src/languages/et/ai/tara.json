  "context": "The Estonian word 'tara' has multiple meanings depending on context. It primarily refers to fences or barriers made of various materials (wooden planks, metal bars) that enclose areas like fields, yards, and gardens. In its second meaning, it can refer to an enclosed area for livestock. Additionally, 'tara' can be used metaphorically to describe circular formations - either astronomical phenomena like meteor rings around the moon or sun, or figurative descriptions of halos or circular arrangements around objects."
