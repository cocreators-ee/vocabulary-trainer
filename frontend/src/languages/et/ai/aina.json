  "context": "The word 'aina' in Estonian is an adverb that means 'always', 'constantly', or 'continuously'. It indicates something happening repeatedly or without interruption. In the examples: 'Aina olen siin' means 'I am always here', 'Tule aita meid!' can be interpreted as 'Come help us continuously!' (though this might depend on context), and 'Kas sa tuled aina?' means 'Do you come always?' or more naturally in English 'Do you always come?'. The word is used to express frequency of actions or states."
