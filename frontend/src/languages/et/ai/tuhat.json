  "context": "The Estonian word 'tuhat' is the cardinal numeral for one thousand (1000). It's used in counting, to indicate quantities of 1000 items, and as a numerical value. The word has various grammatical forms including tuhande (partitive), tuhandet (genitive), and tuhanded (plural adjective form). It can be used literally in mathematical contexts ('can count up to a thousand'), for counting people or objects ('over a thousand people work at the factory'), metaphorically ('only a few thousand steps from school home'), and as part of compound words like 'aastatuhat' (millennium)."
