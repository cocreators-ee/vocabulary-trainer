  "context": "The word 'teaksin' is the conditional form of the Estonian verb 'tema' (to know). It translates to English as 'I would know' or 'I would be aware'. This form indicates a hypothetical situation - what someone would know under certain conditions. The infinitive form is 'teada', and in present tense first person singular it's 'tean'. The conditional mood expresses possibility or hypothetical knowledge rather than current certainty."
