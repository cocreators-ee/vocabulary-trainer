  "context": "The word 'kirjutanud' is the past participle form of the Estonian verb 'kirjutama', which means 'to write'. It functions as an adjective or noun meaning 'one who has written' or something that has been written. In the dictionary definition, it specifically refers to someone who has written a letter, article, etc., and is used in reflexive expressions about oneself.
