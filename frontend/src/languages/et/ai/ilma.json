  "context": "The Estonian word 'ilma' has multiple meanings depending on context. As a preposition with the abessive case, it means 'without'. As an adverb, it can mean 'free of charge' or 'on the house'. It's derived from Proto-Finnic and appears to be related to the genitive singular of 'ilm'. In different grammatical contexts, it expresses being without something essential either physically (without glasses) or conceptually (without a prolonged explanation)."
