  "context": "In Estonian, 'ilma' is an adessive case form that means 'without' or 'lacking'. It's commonly used to indicate the absence of something. The word comes from the genitive singular of 'ilm' (world/air/weather), but in this context functions as a postposition meaning 'without'. When using ilma, it typically requires the partitive case for the object that is absent."
