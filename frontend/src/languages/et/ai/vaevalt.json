  "context": "The Estonian word 'vaevalt' is an adverb that expresses difficulty or insufficiency. It can be used in several contexts: 1) To express doubt about the possibility of something happening (similar to 'barely possible'); 2) Temporally meaning 'just recently' or 'with great difficulty'; 3) Spatially indicating a small distance or amount ('just barely enough'); 4) Describing poor ability due to weakness, intoxication, or other limiting factors ('with difficulty'). It often emphasizes that something is at the very limit of possibility."
