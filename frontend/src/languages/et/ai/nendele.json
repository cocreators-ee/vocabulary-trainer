  "context": "The Estonian word 'nendele' is the allative case form of the demonstrative pronoun 'need', meaning 'these'. The allative case indicates direction or movement toward something, so 'nendele' translates to English as 'to these' or 'to them'. It's used when referring to moving towards a group of people or things that are nearby or have been previously mentioned."
