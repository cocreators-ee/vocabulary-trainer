  "context": "The Estonian word 'nendele' is the allative case of the demonstrative pronoun/noun 'need'. It means 'to these/those' and indicates direction toward something or someone. In English, it would typically be translated as 'to them', 'for these', or 'with those' depending on context. The -le suffix in Estonian grammar specifically indicates movement toward or destination."
