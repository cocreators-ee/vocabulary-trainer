  "context": "The word 'suurte' is the plural partitive form of the Estonian adjective 'suur', meaning 'big' or 'large'. In this case, it indicates multiple big/large things in partitive case (used for indefinite objects). The '-te' ending shows it's in plural, and it modifies a plural noun that is in the partitive case. This form would typically follow a plural noun in Estonian grammar."
