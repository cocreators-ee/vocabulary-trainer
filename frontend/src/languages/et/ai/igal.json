  "context": "The word 'igal' is the adessive singular form of the Estonian determiner 'iga'. It functions as a preposition meaning 'on/at each/every' but when used with the genitive case (as in 'igal juhul'), it means 'in any case, regardless, under any circumstances'. In these examples from Estonian literature and subtitles, it's used to express that something must happen no matter what - whether someone is left out of a game, needs to cross a bridge, or describing someone's character."
