  "context": "The word 'kuud' is the genitive plural form of the Estonian word 'kuu', which can mean either 'month' or 'moon'. In Estonian, the same root word is used for both concepts. The genitive case in Estonian typically indicates possession or association, so 'kuud' could translate to 'months' (possessive) when referring to something belonging to months, or it could simply be the plural form of 'month' depending on context. It can also refer to 'moons' as the plural form of 'moon'. The specific meaning would depend on the context in which it's used."
