  "context": "The Estonian word 'vait' is an adverb that means quietly or silently. It describes a state of being quiet, silent, or motionless. The word can be used to describe people remaining quiet (sitting quietly), telling someone to be quiet ('Vait, poisijõmpsikas!' - Quiet, little rascal!), or things becoming silent (the scraping behind the wall fell silent). It's often used in contexts where silence is expected or maintained."
