  "context": "The word 'kaunis' in Estonian has two main meanings: 1) as an adjective meaning 'beautiful' when describing appearance or qualities, and 2) as an adverb meaning 'quite', 'rather', or 'fairly' to modify the degree of something. In its primary form as an adjective, it follows regular declension patterns in Estonian with genitive 'kauni', partitive 'kaunist', comparative 'kaunim', and superlative 'kõige kaunim'. As an adverb, it intensifies adjectives similarly to English words like 'quite' or 'rather'."
