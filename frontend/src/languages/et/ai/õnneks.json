  "context": "The Estonian word 'õnneks' is an adverb that means 'luckily', 'fortunately', or 'thankfully'. It's derived from the noun 'õnn' (luck, fortune) and the suffix '-eks' which forms adverbs indicating cause or reason. This word is used to express that something fortunate happened or that a potentially negative situation was avoided due to luck or good circumstances."
