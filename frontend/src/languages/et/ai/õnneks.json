  "context": "Õnneks is an Estonian adverb that means 'fortunately' or 'luckily'. It is used in situations where something positive happens by chance or as a fortunate turn of events. The word derives from the noun 'õnn' (happiness, fortune) and appears here in its translative case form, functioning as an adverb to express that something turned out well unexpectedly."
