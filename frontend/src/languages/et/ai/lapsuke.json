  "context": "The word 'lapsuke' in Estonian is a diminutive form of 'laps' (child). It's used to refer to a young child, often with affectionate or endearing connotations. The -ke suffix creates a diminutive form, making it similar to saying 'little child' or 'dear little one' in English. It can be used for both boys and girls, though the dictionary shows additional examples where it's specifically used for girls/women (as 'lapsukene'). The word carries a sense of youth and tenderness."
