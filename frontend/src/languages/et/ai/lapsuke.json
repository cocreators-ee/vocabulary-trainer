  "context": "The word 'lapsuke' in Estonian is a diminutive form of the word 'laps', which means 'child'. The suffix '-uke' is commonly used in Estonian to create affectionate or diminutive forms. So 'lapsuke' literally translates to 'little child' and carries an endearing, affectionate connotation when referring to small children or babies. It's similar to how English might use terms like 'wee one' or 'tiny tot' for young children."
