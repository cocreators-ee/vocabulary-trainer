  "context": "In Estonian, 'pluss' is a loanword from English that functions as both an adjective and a noun. It's commonly used in mathematical contexts to mean the plus sign (+), but can also refer to something positive or additional. The word remains unchanged in different grammatical cases in its basic form."
