  "context": "In Estonian, 'ärka' is an interjection used to express surprise or confusion. It's similar in function to English words like 'Huh?', 'What?' or 'Meh?'. The word appears to be used at the end of questions or exclamations to seek clarification or show puzzlement. In the example sentences, it's used as a response to being woken up ('Ärka üles!' - Wake up!) and in questioning situations where someone is expressing doubt or seeking confirmation."
