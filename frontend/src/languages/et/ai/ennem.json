  "context": "The Estonian word 'ennem' is an adverb that means 'before', 'earlier', or 'sooner'. It's used to indicate something happening at a time prior to another event. The word often appears in constructions comparing two time points, such as 'ennem...kui...' (before...than...). In the examples provided, it shows usage in various contexts: 1) indicating a general preference for morning over evening; 2) suggesting coming earlier than planned due to a deadline; and 3) expressing that more work needs to be done before being ready. The word is comparable to English 'before' but can also carry the sense of 'sooner' when implying urgency or preference in timing."
