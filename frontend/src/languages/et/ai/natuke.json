  "context": "The Estonian word 'natuke' is an adverb that means 'a little bit', 'slightly', or 'somewhat'. It's used to indicate a small degree or quantity of something. In the example sentences, it modifies adjectives (külm/cold, paha/bad, väsinud/tired) to show that these qualities exist only to a small extent."
