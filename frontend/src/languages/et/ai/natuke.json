  "context": "The word 'natuke' is an Estonian adverb that means 'a little bit', 'somewhat', or 'slightly'. It's used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to indicate a small degree or amount. For example, in the first sentence 'Ma natuke olen nõrgem,' it modifies the verb 'olen' (am) to indicate that the speaker is a little weaker than usual. In Estonian grammar, this type of adverb typically doesn't change form based on gender or number."
