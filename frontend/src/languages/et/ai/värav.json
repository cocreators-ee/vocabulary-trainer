Primarily, it refers to a physical gate or door in a wall, fence, or building that allows entry and exit - like a garden gate, hospital gate, or city gate. In sports contexts, particularly football (soccer) and hockey, 'värav' means a goal where players try to score by getting the ball/puck into it. It can also refer to other types of openings or barriers, such as floodgates controlling water flow."
