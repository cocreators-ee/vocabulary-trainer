  "context": "The Estonian word 'seljast' is an adessive case form meaning 'from behind' or 'from the back'. It derives from the root word 'selg' (back). The -st ending indicates movement away from a surface, in this case from the back of something or someone. This grammatical case is used to express location relative to a surface."
