  "context": "The Estonian word 'seljast' is the elative case singular form of 'selg', meaning 'back'. In grammar, the elative case indicates movement or removal from within something. So 'seljast' specifically means 'from the back' or 'off one's back', indicating that something is being removed, taken off, or moved away from someone's back or from behind them. This form would be used when describing an action where clothing like a coat or backpack is being removed from someone's back, or when something is being taken from behind someone."
