  "context": "The Estonian word 'kellelegi' is an allative form of the pronoun 'keegi', meaning 'someone'. It functions similarly to English 'to someone' and indicates that something is directed towards or given to a specific person, though their identity isn't specified. In grammatical terms, it's in the allative case which typically shows direction towards or destination."
