  "context": "The Estonian word 'kellelegi' is a partitive case form that indicates direction or benefit towards an unspecified person. It's formed from the interrogative pronoun 'keegi' (someone) with the '-le' suffix indicating motion toward, and '-gi' which adds emphasis or inclusiveness. This construction shows how Estonian grammar uses case endings to express relationships between people and actions."
