  "context": "Emme is a childish term for mother in Estonian, similar to 'mommy' in English. It's often used by young children when addressing their mother. The word appears to be baby-talk, as indicated by its etymology comparison with 'mama'. In the example from H. Lepik's work, it shows a child calling out to their mother using this affectionate term."
