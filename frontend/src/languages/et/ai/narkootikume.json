  "context": "The Estonian word 'narkootikume' is composed of 'narko-' (relating to narcotics) and '-otikume' (instrumental plural suffix), literally meaning 'with narcotics/instrument for narcotics'. It refers specifically to dogs trained in police work to detect illegal drugs, commonly known as drug detection dogs or sniffer dogs. These specially trained dogs are used by law enforcement to locate hidden narcotics through their highly developed sense of smell."
