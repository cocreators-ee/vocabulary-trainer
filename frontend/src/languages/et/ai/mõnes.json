  "context": "The word 'mõnes' is the inessive singular form of the Estonian pronoun 'mõni'. It means 'in some' and is used to indicate that something exists or happens in certain places among multiple possibilities. The inessive case indicates location within something, so 'mõnes' specifically refers to being located within some place(s) or among some things."
