  "context": "The word 'tähevärav' is a compound noun in Estonian, meaning literally 'star gate'. It combines 'täht' (star) and 'värav' (gate). This term refers to a theoretical passage through space-time or portal that connects distant points in the universe. The term became widely known from science fiction, particularly the TV series 'Stargate SG-1'. In Estonian, compound nouns like this are formed by joining two words without spaces, and they function as single lexical units."
