  "context": "The Estonian word 'maal' is an adverb that means 'on the land', 'in the countryside', or 'outdoors'. It typically refers to being outside of urban areas, in rural or natural settings. The word contrasts with 'linnas' (in the city) and is commonly used when describing activities, locations, or states related to rural life."
