  "context": "Kala is the Estonian word for 'fish'. It refers to any aquatic vertebrate animal that breathes through gills, moves using fins and a tail, and has scales. The word can be used both in singular form (kala) and plural forms (kalad - nominative plural, kalu - partitive plural). In Estonian, the noun 'kala' follows specific declension patterns with different cases having different endings: nominative kala/kalad, genitive kalade, partitive kala/kalu, etc. The word is commonly used in everyday language when talking about catching fish (kalapüük), eating fish, or referring to the animal itself."
