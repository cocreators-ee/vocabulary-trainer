  "context": "The Estonian word 'kurb' is an adjective that means sad, gloomy, or miserable. It describes a state of unhappiness, sorrow, or depression. In the plural form 'kured', it becomes a noun meaning 'cranes', which is a completely different word - this shows how important grammatical context is in Estonian."
