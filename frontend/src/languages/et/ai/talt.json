  "context": "The Estonian pronoun 'talt' is the ablative singular form of 'ta', meaning 'he/she'. It indicates movement away or separation from a person and translates to English phrases like 'from him/her', 'off of him/her', or 'out of him/her'. When used unstressed in sentences, it refers to third-person singular pronouns. The stressed form would be 'temalt' (ablative of 'tema')."
