  "context": "The word 'talt' is an Estonian adessive case form of the third person singular pronoun, used to indicate source or origin. It means 'from him', 'from her', or 'from it'. The adessive case in Estonian typically indicates location near something, but when combined with prepositions like 'saada' (to get/receive), it can indicate source."
