  "context": "In Estonian, 'ni' is not a standalone word but appears as part of compound words like 'nii' meaning 'so', 'such', or 'very'. It's used to express degree and intensity in adjectives and adverbs. The word can also be part of the negative particle 'mitte', but on its own, 'ni' doesn't have a complete meaning in Estonian."
