Nikkel is a chemical element (Ni) that is a silvery-white metal known for being easily workable. It can refer to both the pure metal and its alloys, compounds, or even metaphorically to coins or small change. The word forms include nikel (nominative), nikli (genitive singular), and niklit (partitive singular)."
