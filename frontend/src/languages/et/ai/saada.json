  "context": "In Estonian, 'saada' has multiple meanings depending on context. It primarily functions as the da-infinitive form of 'saama' (to get/receive) and is also used in expressions about ability or possibility ('to be able to/can'). The word can indicate receiving something physical, achieving something, being capable of doing something, or having permission. In imperative form, it means 'send' when addressing someone directly."
