  "context": "Siiamaani is an Estonian adverb that indicates time or duration up to the present moment. It's used to express that something has been happening from a past point in time until now, or to refer to events or situations that have occurred up to this current moment. In many contexts it can be translated as 'until now' or 'up to this point'. The word combines 'siia' (here/to here) with the temporal particle 'maani' (until)."
