  "context": "The word 'tänava' is the partitive case form of the Estonian word 'tänav', which means 'street'. In Estonian, the partitive case is used to indicate an incomplete action or to refer to a portion of something. When we see 'tänava', it typically appears in contexts where we're talking about being on a street, near a street, or referring to streets in some context that requires this grammatical form. For example, 'käisime tänava äärtes' means 'we walked along the edge of the street.'"
