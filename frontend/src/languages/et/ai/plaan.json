  "context": "The Estonian word 'plaan' primarily means a plan or arrangement, but it has several related meanings depending on context. It can refer to an intention or scheme (like 'a clever plan'), a formal document outlining activities for a period (like a budget plan), a schedule or timetable, a map or diagram of physical space, a camera shot in film photography, the appearance or look of something, a level or plane in narrative structure, or a perspective or viewpoint. The word is borrowed from German and follows Estonian declension patterns with various grammatical forms."
