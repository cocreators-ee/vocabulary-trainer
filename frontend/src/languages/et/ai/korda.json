  "context": "The word 'korda' in Estonian is an adverb that means 'once' or 'one time'. It can also be used to indicate a repeated action, similar to 'repeat' or 'time' when referring to occasions. In its base form, it's often used with numbers to indicate how many times something has happened (e.g., kolmas korda - third time). The word is commonly used in everyday expressions like 'Korra palun!' which means 'Once, please!' used when someone needs attention."
