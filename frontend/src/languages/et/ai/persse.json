  "context": "The word 'persse' is an Estonian colloquial and vulgar expression meaning to mess something up, ruin it, or make a complete mess of things. It's often used in situations where someone has made a serious mistake or caused significant problems. The term derives from the verb 'keerama' (to turn) combined with what appears to be an intensifier. In the examples provided, it's used to describe how someone ruined their situation ('keeras selle asja persse'), how someone ruined their entire life ('keeras neil kogu elu persse'), and specifically how someone messed up/screwed up one's finger again ('sa keerad mu pöidla jälle persse'). This is a strong, informal expression of frustration about things going wrong."
