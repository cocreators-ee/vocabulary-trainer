  "context": "The word 'persse' is a vulgar Estonian curse word used as an interjection or exclamation of anger, frustration, or contempt. It's similar in usage and intensity to English swear words like 'fuck off' or 'damn it'. The word appears to be derived from the Russian word 'пиздеть' (to lie/nonsense) adapted into Estonian slang, though its exact etymology may vary. In context, it's used to express strong negative emotions towards someone or something."
