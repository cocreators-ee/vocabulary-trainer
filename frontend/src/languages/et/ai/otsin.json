  "context": "The word 'otsin' is the 1st person singular present tense form of the Estonian verb 'otsima', which means 'to search for' or 'to look for'. It specifically refers to what 'I am looking for' in the present moment. In Estonian, verbs conjugate based on person and number, so 'otsin' is only used when speaking about oneself (first person) doing the action of searching or looking for something right now."
