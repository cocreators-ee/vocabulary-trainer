  "context": "The Estonian word 'otsin' is the first-person singular present tense form of the verb 'otsima', which means 'to look for' or 'to search'. It indicates an ongoing action where someone is actively seeking something. The '-n' ending at the end of the word indicates that it's in the first person singular (I) and present tense. This is a very common verb used in everyday Estonian when talking about looking for lost items, searching for places, or trying to find people."
