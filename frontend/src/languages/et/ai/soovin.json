  "context": "In Estonian, 'soovin' is the first-person singular present form of the verb 'soovima', meaning 'to wish' or 'to want'. When used with 'edu' (meaning success), it forms the expression 'Soovin edu!' which translates to 'I wish you success!' This is a common phrase used when someone is embarking on something new, challenging, or important. The word 'soovin' literally means 'I want/wish', and in this context, it's expressing goodwill toward someone else's endeavors."
