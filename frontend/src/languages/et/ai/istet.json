  "context": "The word 'istet' appears to be a form of the Estonian verb 'istuma' meaning 'to sit'. It can also relate to maritime terminology where it means 'to take stern anchor'. The first example sentence instructs someone to take stern anchors, while the second invites people to sit down and talk. This dual usage suggests it may have different conjugations or forms depending on context."
