  "context": "The word 'kus' is an Estonian interrogative pronoun used to ask about the location or position of something. It corresponds directly to English 'where'. In questions, it typically appears at the beginning of the sentence. When answering with locations, Estonians often use expressions like 'Seal kus...' (there where...) or 'Siin kus...' (here where...)."
