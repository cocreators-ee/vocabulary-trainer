  "context": "\"Peaksid\" is the 2nd person plural present tense form of the Estonian verb \"pidama\" (to hold, to keep, must/should). It expresses obligation, duty, or what someone should do. The word implies that there is an expectation or requirement for the action to take place. In English, this corresponds closely to modal verbs like \"should,\" \"ought to,\" or \"are supposed to.\""
