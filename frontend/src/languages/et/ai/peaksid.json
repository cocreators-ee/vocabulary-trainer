  "context": "The word 'peaksid' is the conditional form of the Estonian modal verb 'pidama', which means 'to have to' or 'must'. In this case, it's in the 2nd person singular (you) or plural (y'all/you all) conditional form. It expresses obligation, necessity, or what someone should do. The '-sid' ending indicates conditional mood and is commonly used when giving advice or expressing what ought to be done."
