  "context": "The word 'vanem' in Estonian has two main uses: 1) As an adjective meaning 'elder', 'older', or 'senior' when comparing age or position (comparative form of 'vana'). It can refer to people, animals, or objects that are older than others. 2) As a noun meaning 'parent' (father or mother). The word changes its form based on case and number in Estonian grammar."
