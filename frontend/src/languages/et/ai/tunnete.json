  "context": "The word 'tunnete' appears to be a plural form of the Estonian adjective 'tuunne' which means affected, artificial or pretentious. It describes behavior that is not natural but rather put-on or exaggerated. The dictionary definition mentions it relates to acting in an overly mannered way due to some influence (afekteerima). This word typically carries negative connotations when describing someone's behavior as being deliberately unnatural for effect."
