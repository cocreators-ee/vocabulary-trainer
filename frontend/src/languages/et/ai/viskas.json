  "context": "The word 'viskas' appears to be a typo or OCR error in the dictionary definition context. The actual word being defined is 'päkk', which means heel/back of the foot/sole in Estonian. 'Viskas' would typically mean 'throws' or 'casts' in Estonian, but based on the context provided and dictionary definitions, it seems there was an error in how the entry was formatted. The correct analysis should focus on 'päkk' as defined in the dictionary."
