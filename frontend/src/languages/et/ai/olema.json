  "context": "The Estonian verb 'olema' is the equivalent of the English verb 'to be'. It's an irregular verb that changes its form depending on the subject and tense. In present tense, it conjugates as 'olen' (I am), 'oled' (you are), 'on' (he/she/it is), ' oleme' (we are), 'olete' (you plural/formal are), and 'on' (they are). In past tense, common forms include 'oli' (was/were) and 'olid' (were). This verb is fundamental in Estonian grammar as it's used for stating existence, identity, and characteristics."
