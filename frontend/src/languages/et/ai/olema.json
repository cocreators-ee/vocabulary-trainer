  "context": "The Estonian verb 'olema' is the most fundamental verb in Estonian, serving multiple functions including: 1) As a copula linking subject and complement (equivalent to English 'to be'), 2) To indicate existence or presence (similar to English 'there is/are'), 3) To express possession when used with certain cases (adessive for having something, inessive for features/capabilities), 4) As an auxiliary verb forming compound tenses. It's highly irregular and appears in numerous grammatical constructions."
