  "context": "The Estonian adverb 'siit' is a proximal deictic word that points to a location near the speaker, indicating where something originates or comes from. It's used when referring to places close to the speaker as opposed to 'sealt' (from there) which refers to distant locations. 'Siit' can also indicate causation - showing what something results from."
