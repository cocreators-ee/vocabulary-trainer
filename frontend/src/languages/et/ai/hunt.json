  "context": "The Estonian word 'hunt' primarily translates to 'wolf' in English. It can also refer to a dog or hound, but the most common usage is for the wild animal. In broader contexts, it can sometimes carry negative connotations, similar to how 'wolf' is used metaphorically in English (e.g., a predatory person)."
