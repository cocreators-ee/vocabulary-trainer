  "context": "The Estonian word 'bart' appears to be a misspelling or variant of 'baat', which means boat. It refers to watercraft vessels used for transportation or recreation on water. In Estonian, this would typically follow Estonian grammar rules, with possible variations like 'baadi' (genitive case meaning 'of the boat')."
