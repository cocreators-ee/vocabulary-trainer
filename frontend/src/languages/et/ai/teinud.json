  "context": "The word 'teinud' is the past active participle of the Estonian verb 'tegema', meaning 'to do' or 'to make'. It functions as a past tense auxiliary verb, similar to English 'has done' or 'has made'. In compound tenses, it follows the auxiliary verb 'on' (is/has) and agrees with the subject. For example: 'Ta on teinud' means 'He/she has done/made'. The word indicates completion of an action in the past from the speaker's present perspective."
