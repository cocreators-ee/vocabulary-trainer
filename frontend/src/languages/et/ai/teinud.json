  "context": "The Estonian word 'teinud' is the past participle form of the verb 'teha' which means 'to do' or 'to make'. It is used in present perfect tense constructions to indicate completed actions. The '-nud' ending indicates that this is a past participle, and it typically follows an auxiliary verb like 'on' (has) in perfect tenses."
