  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõni' is an indefinite pronoun and adjective that means 'some', 'any', or 'a certain'. It's used to refer to people, things, or situations that are not specifically identified. As a pronoun, it refers to someone/something unspecified (like 'someone' or 'something'), and as an adjective, it modifies nouns with the same meaning. The word has different forms depending on case: nominative singular is 'mõni', genitive singular is 'mõne', partitive can be 'mõnd' or 'mõnda'. It's commonly used to express that there are one or more unspecified items in a group, or when referring to an unspecified person or thing."
