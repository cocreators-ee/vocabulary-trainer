  "context": "The Estonian word 'mõni' is an indefinite pronoun that means 'some', 'a few', or 'several'. It's used to refer to an unspecified number of things or people. As a pronoun, it typically appears in the partitive case ('mõnda') when modified by adjectives or when used as an object. In its basic form 'mõni', it's often followed by a noun in the partitive case (e.g., 'mõne inimese' - some person). The word indicates that there is more than one but not a specific number of items being referred to."
