  "context": "The word 'kurat' in Estonian has multiple meanings. Primarily it refers to the devil or Satan as a religious concept - an evil spirit opposing God. It's also one of the most common and strongest swear words/interjections used to express strong negative emotions, similar to English 'damn it!' or 'hell'. As an intensifier, it can be used in various contexts - expressing frustration (Kurat võtku! - Damn it!), confusion (Mis kurat me peame tegema? - What the hell do we need to do?), or as a modifier for emphasis (Kuradi vanamees - That devilish old man). The word is quite soft compared to English equivalents and is rarely considered truly vulgar."
