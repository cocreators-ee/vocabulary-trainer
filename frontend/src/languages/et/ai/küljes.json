  "context": "The Estonian word 'kyljes' is an inessive case form of the word kylj, which means 'side'. It indicates location next to or beside something. This grammatical case (inessive) shows being inside or within a location. When used with prepositions like 'küla' (village), it forms compound expressions meaning 'in the village' but more commonly it's used as 'kyljes' to mean physically located adjacent to an object or place."
