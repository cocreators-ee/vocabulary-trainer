  "context": "The Estonian word 'üksi' is an adverb with two main meanings: 1) alone or by oneself without other people present (physical isolation), and 2) only, exclusively (meaning limitation to a single thing or person). In the first sense, it describes being separated from others or not having companionship. In the second sense, it emphasizes that something is limited to just one thing or person, excluding everything else."
