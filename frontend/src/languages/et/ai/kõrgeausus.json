  "context": "Kõrgeausus is an Estonian term of address used for high-ranking individuals or authorities. It's a compound word combining 'kõrge' (high) and 'ausus' (honor/dignity). The term expresses special respect when addressing someone of superior status, similar to how English speakers might use 'Your Excellency', 'Your Highness', or 'Your Honor'. It was traditionally used when speaking to royalty, nobility, high officials, or other persons in positions of authority. The word shows the Estonian language's ability to create formal honorifics by combining concepts of height (status) and dignity/honor."
