  "context": "'Meetri' is the Estonian word for 'meter' (the unit of length). It's in the singular nominative case. In Estonian, measurement units often don't require a separate plural marker when used with numbers - you might say 'kahe meetri pikkune' (two meter long) instead of 'kaks meetrit'. The word can be declined in different cases depending on how it's used in the sentence."
