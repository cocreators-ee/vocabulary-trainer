  "context": "The Estonian word 'näeme' is the 1st person plural present tense form of the verb 'nägema', which means 'to see'. It can be used in several contexts: 1) When people are saying goodbye, it functions like 'see you tomorrow' (Näeme homme!), 2) In statements about what we currently perceive (Me näeme uut linna - We see a new city), and 3) As an expression of future intention or arrangement to meet again. The word is commonly used in everyday conversation as both a literal description of seeing something and as a farewell expression similar to 'see you'."
