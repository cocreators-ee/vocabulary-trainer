  "context": "The word 'annaksid' is the conditional mood (conditional tense) form of the Estonian verb 'anda', which means 'to give'. In English, it corresponds to 'would give' or similar constructions with auxiliary verbs. The '-ksid' ending indicates this is the second person singular conditional form (you would give). It's used for hypothetical situations, polite requests, or expressing what someone would do under certain conditions."
