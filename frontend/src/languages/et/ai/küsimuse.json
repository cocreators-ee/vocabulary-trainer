  "context": "The word 'küsimuse' is the genitive case of 'küsimus', meaning 'of the question' or 'belonging to the question'. In Estonian, the genitive case typically shows possession or relationship. The base form 'küsimus' means 'question', and when it takes the '-e' ending in genitive case, it indicates that something belongs to or is related to a question. This form would be used after certain prepositions or in possessive constructions."
