  "context": "The Estonian word 'ilus' is an adjective that means beautiful or pretty. It's used to describe something as aesthetically pleasing or attractive in appearance. The word can be applied to people, objects, nature scenes, or experiences. In Estonian grammar, adjectives must agree with the noun they modify in number (singular/plural) and case. For example, 'ilus' would become 'ilusad' in plural nominative form."
