  "context": "The Estonian word 'olend' refers to a living creature or being. It can describe animals (both real and mythical), humans, or any entity that has life. The word comes from the verb 'olema' (to be) with the suffix '-nd', literally meaning 'one who is'. In Estonian grammar, it's a masculine noun of ÕS type 2/õpik with no gradation, and follows specific declension patterns for different cases. It can refer to both physical creatures like animals and humans as well as supernatural or mythological beings."
