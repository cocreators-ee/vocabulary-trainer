  "context": "The Estonian word 'maailm' is a versatile noun with multiple meanings. It primarily refers to the world/universe/earth as a physical entity, but also extends to mean society/environment/life in various contexts. It can refer to the entire cosmos, the planet Earth, specific regions of the world (like Vana Maailm/New World), different cultural or social spheres (the business world, academic world), mental and emotional realms (someone's inner world), and is used idiomatically to mean 'a lot' or 'very much'. The word derives from Proto-Finnic *maailma, combining maa (earth/land) + ilm (weather/sky)."
