  "context": "In Estonian, 'lits' is primarily a derogatory term for a prostitute or woman who engages in sexual relationships for money. It can also refer to an easy or loose woman with promiscuous behavior, or describe someone as vile or worthless (in the adjectival form). The word has strong negative connotations and is often used as an insult. In its adjectival forms 'litsakas' and 'liiderlik', it describes women who are considered to have loose morals or be flirtatious."
