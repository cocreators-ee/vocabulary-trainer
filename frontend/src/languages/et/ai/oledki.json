  "context": "The word 'oledki' is an emphatic form of the verb 'olema' (to be) in Estonian. It combines 'oled' (you are) with the particle 'ki', which adds emphasis or confirmation to the statement. This construction is used to affirm something strongly, often when responding to a question or expressing agreement with enthusiasm."
