The word has multiple meanings including: 1) A publication consisting of printed pages bound with covers - this is the most common meaning; 2) A major division in an artistic work, like books within a novel; 3) A notebook for making notes or records; 4) A collection of receipts or tokens; 5) A register or directory. The word comes from Old East Slavic 'gramota' and relates to the Greek 'grámmata' meaning letters or writing."
