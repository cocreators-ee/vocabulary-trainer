  "context": "The Estonian word 'üksnes' is an adverb with multiple related meanings. It can indicate that something or someone is less than necessary, expected, or assumed (like English 'only just', 'barely'), but it most commonly functions as a restrictive marker meaning 'only', 'just', 'merely', or 'solely'. It excludes other possibilities beyond what's mentioned. Additionally, it can be used for emphasis ('just', 'only') and contrastively to connect sentence parts where the latter limits or partially negates the former (like English 'not only...but also'). In Estonian grammar, it often appears in the construction 'mitte üksnes... vaid (ka)' which corresponds to the English 'not only... but (also)'. The word is versatile and context-dependent, always serving to restrict or limit the scope of what follows."
