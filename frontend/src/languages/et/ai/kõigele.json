  "context": "The word 'kõigele' is an Estonian adverbial form that means 'to the most/first' or 'above all'. It's derived from the superlative form of 'palju' (much) and is used to indicate something that should be prioritized or given first consideration. The word appears to be part of a construction where it points to what needs attention or comes first in importance."
