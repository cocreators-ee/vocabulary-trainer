  "context": "The word 'ajaga' is an Estonian adverbial form meaning 'with time', 'in terms of time', or indicating duration/temporal relationship. It's often used to describe the temporal aspect of something - whether it happens within a certain timeframe, takes a specific amount of time, or relates to timing considerations. In compound words like 'tunniajaline' (hourly), 'pikaajaline' (long-term), and 'lühiajaline' (short-term), it forms the basis for describing temporal characteristics."
