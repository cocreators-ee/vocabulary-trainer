  "context": "The word 'südant' is the partitive case form of the Estonian noun 'süda', which means 'heart'. In Estonian, nouns change their endings depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The partitive case ending '-t' indicates that the heart is being referred to in an incomplete or indefinite manner - it could mean 'a heart', 'some heart', or be used in contexts where the object is not fully completed or definite."
