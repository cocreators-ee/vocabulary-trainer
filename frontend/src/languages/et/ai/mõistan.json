  "context": "The Estonian interjection 'mõistan' is used to express understanding, realization, or discovery. It conveys a moment of comprehension when someone suddenly understands something that was previously unclear. The word can also indicate pleasant surprise, interest, or amusement at information being revealed. It's similar to saying 'aha!' in English when you suddenly understand something or make an interesting connection."
