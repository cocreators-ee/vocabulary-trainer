  "context": "The word 'koha' in Estonian primarily refers to the zander, a freshwater fish species of the pike-perch family. It's a common fish found in both fresh and brackish waters. The word appears to be borrowed from Proto-Germanic through Proto-Finnic. In Estonian grammar, it follows declension patterns where the genitive form is 'koha', partitive is also 'koha', and plural forms include 'kohad' (nominative), 'kohasid' (partitive), etc."
