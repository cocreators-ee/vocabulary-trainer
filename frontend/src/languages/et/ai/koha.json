  "context": "In Estonian, 'koha' is the partitive form of the word 'koht', which means place or location. The partitive case indicates an incomplete object or partial aspect. So 'koha' can be used to refer to a place in contexts where it's not being referred to as a complete entity. For example, 'minu koha on see laud' means 'My place is this table.' The word appears feminine by its ending '-a', which is typical for the partitive case of feminine nouns in Estonian."
