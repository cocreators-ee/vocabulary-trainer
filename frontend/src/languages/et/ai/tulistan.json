  "context": "In Estonian, 'tulistan' is the 1st person singular present form of the verb 'tulistama', which means 'to shoot' or 'to fire'. It can refer to firing a weapon, taking photographs with a camera, or metaphorically expressing strong emotions. The word comes from 'tuli' (fire) and the verb suffix '-stama'. When used with weapons, it refers to discharging ammunition; when used with cameras, it means capturing an image."
