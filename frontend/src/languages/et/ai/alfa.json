  "context": "The word 'alfa' is used in Estonian to refer to the first letter of the Greek alphabet (alpha). It can also be used more generally to describe someone who is dominant or takes the lead role in a group, similar to how 'alpha' is used in English slang. In astronomy contexts, it may refer to the brightest star in a constellation."
