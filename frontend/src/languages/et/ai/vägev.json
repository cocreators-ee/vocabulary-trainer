  "context": "The Estonian adjective 'vägev' means powerful or strong. It can describe physical strength and size (like a powerful forest, large mountains), power of living beings (strong body parts), quantity (large amounts), intensity (powerful wind, loud applause), moral authority (powerful king, influential ruler), and emotional states (intense hunger). The word changes form based on grammatical case - for example, 'vägeva' is genitive singular, 'vägevat' is partitive singular, and 'vägevad' is nominative plural."
