  "context": "The Estonian word 'te' is the short form of 'teie' and serves as the plural pronoun meaning 'you'. It's used when addressing multiple people or showing politeness to a single person. Unlike English which uses 'you' for both singular and plural, Estonian distinguishes between familiar 'sina/sa' (singular informal) and formal/polite 'te/teie' (plural/formal). The word declines in various grammatical cases like nominative, genitive, partitive, etc., adapting to different sentence structures."
