  "context": "The Estonian word 'jumal' translates to 'god' in English. It refers to a higher supernatural being or power that is worshipped and served in religion. The word can be used both for polytheistic deities (multiple gods) and monotheistic God (single supreme deity). In its basic form, it's a masculine noun, but it has plural forms like 'jumalad' (gods) and various case endings depending on grammatical function. It also appears in compound words like 'päikesejumal' (sun god) and in idiomatic expressions where it carries emotional weight or emphasis."
