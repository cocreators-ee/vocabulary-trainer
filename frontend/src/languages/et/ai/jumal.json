  "context": "The word 'jumal' in Estonian refers to God, deity, or a divine being. It is the singular form of the noun and represents a supreme power or spiritual entity that people may worship or believe in. In religious contexts, it can refer specifically to the Christian God, but can also be used more generally for any god-like figure or supernatural being."
