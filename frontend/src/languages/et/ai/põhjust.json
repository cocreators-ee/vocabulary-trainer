  "context": "The Estonian word 'põhjust' is the partitive form of the noun 'põhjus', which means 'reason' or 'cause'. It appears in contexts where we're talking about a reason in an incomplete or non-specified amount, often used with verbs that take the partitive case. The basic form 'põhjus' would be translated as 'a reason/the reason', while 'põhjust' is more like '(of) a reason' or some amount of reason."
