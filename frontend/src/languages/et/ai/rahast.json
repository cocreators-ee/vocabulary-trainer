  "context": "The Estonian word 'rahast' appears to be related to the verb 'poleerima' (to polish). In this context, 'rahast' seems to mean something like 'with money' or 'using resources,' but the specific meaning is unclear. The dictionary definition shows it used in a sentence asking how someone dared to leave home with so little money, suggesting it might relate to making something clean or smooth through some means involving resources."
