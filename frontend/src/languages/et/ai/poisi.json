  "context": "The Estonian word 'poisi' is in the elative case (from/away from case) of the noun 'pois', which means 'boy'. The elative case indicates movement away from or out of something, so 'poisi' can mean 'from a boy' or 'out of a boy' depending on context. It's formed by adding the suffix '-i' to the genitive stem."
