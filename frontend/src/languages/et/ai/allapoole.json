  "context": "The Estonian word 'allapoole' is an adverb that means downwards or towards the bottom. It indicates movement in a downward direction or position below something else. The word combines 'alla-' (meaning down) and '-poole' (meaning direction/towards), so it literally points to movement toward a lower position."
