  "context": "The Estonian word 'kasuks' is a postposition used to indicate that something is done for someone's or something's benefit, in their favor, or to their advantage. It follows the noun it modifies and expresses purpose or benefit. For example, 'rahva kasuks' means 'for the people's benefit', 'oma kasuks' means 'for one's own benefit', and 'kirjutamisviisi kasuks' means 'in favor of the writing style'. This usage is similar to English expressions like 'for someone's sake' or 'to someone's advantage'."
