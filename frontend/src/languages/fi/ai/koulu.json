  "context": "The word 'koulu' is the Finnish noun for 'school'. It refers to an educational institution where students receive instruction, typically referring to primary or secondary schools. In Finnish grammar, when used with certain cases like the illative (-un/-yn ending), it indicates movement toward a location ('to school'). The word can be modified by possessive suffixes to indicate ownership (like 'kouluuni' meaning 'my school') and follows regular declension patterns in Finnish."
