  "context": "The Finnish word 'hidas' is an adjective that means slow. It can also refer to something or someone being sluggish or not quick in speed or movement. The word declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'hitaat' is the plural nominative form meaning 'slow ones'.  The suffix '-sti' can be added to create an adverb, like 'hidasti' which means slowly."
