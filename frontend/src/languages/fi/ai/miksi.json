  "context": "The Finnish word 'miksi' translates to 'why' in English. It is used to ask about the cause or purpose of something. As indicated by the dictionary definition, it can also be used with negative verb forms like 'miksen' (I don’t), 'mikset' (you don’t) and 'miksei' (he/she doesn’t). The word originates from the translative singular form of 'mikä', which means 'what'."
