  "context": "The Finnish word 'tai' most commonly means 'or'. It is used to present a choice between two or more options. It functions as an inclusive 'or', meaning that both options can be possible, unlike 'vai' which presents an exclusive choice. The word has some archaic alternatives like 'tahi' and legalistic variations like 'taikka', but in modern Finnish 'tai' is the most common form."
