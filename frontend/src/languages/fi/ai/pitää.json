  "context": "The Finnish verb 'pitää' is incredibly versatile and has many meanings. It can mean 'to hold', 'to keep', 'to like', or even express obligation ('must' or 'should'). The specific meaning depends heavily on the context.  It’s often used with a partitive object when referring to physically holding something, but it also appears in impersonal constructions expressing necessity. For example, 'Minun täytyy pitää huolta...' means 'I must take care of...'. It's important to note that the third-person singular form 'pitää' does not exhibit final gemination, unlike other forms."
