  "context": "'Minua' is the partitive case form of the Finnish pronoun 'minä', which means 'I'. The partitive case is used in Finnish to indicate partial action, incomplete states, or as an object in certain contexts. When used with verbs like 'rakastan' (love), 'auttaa' (help), it shows who is being loved or helped. It's also used after prepositions and with some verbs that take a partitive object."
