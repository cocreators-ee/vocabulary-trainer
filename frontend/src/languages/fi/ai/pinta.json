  "context": "The Finnish word 'pinta' primarily means 'surface' or 'top layer'. It can refer to the physical surface of an object, such as the surface of a table or ground. As in the examples, it's used to describe characteristics like cleanliness ('siisti') and texture ('pehme채'). The word is also used in compound words with '-pinta' meaning 'surface', and when pluralized (pinnoilla) means 'on surfaces'."
