  "context": "The Finnish word 'taivas' has multiple meanings depending on context. It can refer to the physical sky that we see above us, or it can mean heaven in a religious/spiritual sense. In its basic form, it's often used with adjectives to describe the appearance of the sky (e.g., 'sininen taivas' - blue sky). The word is commonly used in everyday Finnish conversation about weather, astronomy, and spiritual topics."
