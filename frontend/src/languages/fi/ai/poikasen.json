  "context": "The Finnish word 'poikasen' is the partitive singular form of 'poika', which means son or boy. It's used when you're referring to some aspect of a son, but not the entire entity. For example, in the sentence 'Ostin uuden poikasen' (I bought a new son), it indicates you have acquired something that belongs to or relates to a son conceptually - though this is unusual phrasing as people typically don't buy sons literally. The '-nen' ending often denotes smallness or endearment in Finnish, making 'poikasen' suggestively mean 'little son' or 'small child'."
