  "context": "The Finnish verb 'tuoda' means 'to bring'. It is a transitive verb, meaning it requires an object. A key aspect of this word is the directionality – the action implies movement *towards* the speaker or a reference point. This contrasts with 'viedä', which means 'to take away' and indicates movement *away* from the speaker. The word can also mean to supply or contribute, lead, guide, yield, produce, import, etc."
