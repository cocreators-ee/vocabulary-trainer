  "context": "The Finnish verb 'oppia' means 'to learn'. It can be used both transitively (with an object, like learning a new language) and intransitively (learning to do something). The dictionary definition shows various conjugations of the verb in different tenses and moods.  It is important to note that it often takes illative case for infinitives ('to do' form), elative ('about something') or translative ('to be something')."
