  "context": "The word 'yhdeksän' is the basic numeral for nine in Finnish. It belongs to a group of numbers that have slightly irregular forms, particularly in older texts where the nominative singular form 'yhdeksä' was used more frequently. The current standard form is the genitive 'yhdeksän', which is also used as the nominative.  It declines based on case, with different endings for singular and plural forms, similar to other Finnish nouns. You can see variations like 'yhdeksät' (plural nominative) or 'yhdeksää' (partitive singular). It’s often used in compounds such as 'kahdeksankymmentäyhdeksän' which means eighty-nine."
