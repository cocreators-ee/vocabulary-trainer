  "context": "The Finnish word 'alle' is a preposition and postposition with multiple meanings. It can mean 'under', 'less than', or 'beneath'. It’s the allative singular form of the stem 'ala-'. As a preposition, it takes a number as an object to indicate something being less than that amount. As a postposition, it indicates movement or position underneath something else and is followed by the genitive case."
