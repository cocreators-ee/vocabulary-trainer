  "context": "The Finnish word 'joka' is a versatile pronoun that functions as both a relative pronoun and an indefinite quantifier. As a relative pronoun, it introduces clauses to identify or describe nouns (like 'which,' 'who,' 'that' in English). As an indefinite quantifier, it means 'every' when referring to all members of a group. The specific meaning depends on the grammatical context in which it appears."
