  "context": "The Finnish word 'olisi' is the conditional form of the verbolla' (to be). It's used in hypothetical situations, polite requests, or when talking about what might have happened. In English, it corresponds to 'would be', 'could be', 'might be', or 'were to be'. This form appears in conditional sentences and often depends on context for its exact translation."
