  "context": "The Finnish word 'kieli' refers to a language or tongue. It can also refer to the physical organ in your mouth, but more commonly it means a system of communication used by a community. The word declines based on grammatical case and number (singular/plural), as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'kielet' is the plural form meaning 'languages'.  The possessive forms indicate who owns or speaks the language, like 'kieleni' which means 'my language'."
