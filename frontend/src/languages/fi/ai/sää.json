  "context": "The word 'sää' in Finnish means 'weather'. It originates from Proto-Finnic *sää and is related to words for air and sky in other Finno-Ugric languages. The word declines based on grammatical case, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.). There are also possessive forms showing who owns or relates to the weather ('my weather', 'your weather')."
