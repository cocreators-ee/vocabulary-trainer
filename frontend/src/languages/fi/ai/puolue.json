  "context": "The word 'puolue' in Finnish refers to a political party or, more broadly, any faction or bloc with shared interests. It originates from the word 'side' and was coined in 1845 by August Ahlqvist. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, indicating its role within a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.).  It can also be used to describe possessive relationships ('my party', 'your party' and so on)."
