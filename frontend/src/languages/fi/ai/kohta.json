  "context": "The Finnish word 'kohta' can have several meanings depending on the context. It most commonly means 'soon' or 'in a moment', referring to something happening in the near future. However, it can also refer to a specific 'spot', 'location', 'part' of something (like a speech), or a 'paragraph' in legal text. The word declines based on case and number, as shown in the provided dictionary definitions. For example, 'kohtaa' is the partitive singular form, while 'kohdat' is the nominative plural."
