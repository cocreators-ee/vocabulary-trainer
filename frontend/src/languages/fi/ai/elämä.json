  "context": "The word 'elämä' in Finnish means 'life'. It refers to the state of being alive, a period during which someone is or was alive, or simply existence. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and can also be used in possessive forms to indicate whose life is being referred to (e.g., elämäni - my life)."
