  "context": "The Finnish word 'puku' refers to an outfit, suit, or dress. It's a general term for clothing that forms a complete set, typically consisting of matching pieces. In English contexts, it can translate to 'suit' (for men), 'dress' (for women), or more generally 'outfit'. The word is in singular form and refers to one complete ensemble rather than individual items."
