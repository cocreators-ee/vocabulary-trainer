The word is of type 'pieni', which indicates it doesn't undergo gradation (a vowel change) when inflected.  It can also be used metaphorically to describe someone’s mood, as in 'hyvällä tuulella' meaning 'in a good mood'. The dictionary definitions show the various forms of the word through declension and conjugation."
