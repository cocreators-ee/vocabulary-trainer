  "context": "The word 'piha' in Finnish refers to a yard or garden, typically the area of land directly surrounding a house. It can be small and uncultivated, or more carefully maintained. The declension shows that it changes form depending on its role in the sentence – for example, 'pihan' means 'of the yard', while 'pihaan' indicates movement *to* the yard.  The possessive forms indicate whose yard it is (e.g., 'pihani' means 'my yard')."
