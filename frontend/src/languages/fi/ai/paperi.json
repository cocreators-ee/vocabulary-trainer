  "context": "The Finnish word 'paperi' translates to 'paper' in English. It can refer to the material itself, or a document written on it. The word declines based on case and number; for example, 'paperit' is the plural form meaning 'papers'. The possessive forms also change depending on who owns the paper, like 'paperini' (my paper)."
