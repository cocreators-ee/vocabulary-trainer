  "context": "The word 'perhe' in Finnish means 'family'. It refers to a group of people related by blood, marriage, or adoption. The declension shows different forms depending on the grammatical case, indicating possession (my family, your family), location (in my family) and other relationships. For example, 'perheemme' means 'our family', where 'mme' indicates 'our'. It can also be used in plural form as 'perheet' which simply means families."
