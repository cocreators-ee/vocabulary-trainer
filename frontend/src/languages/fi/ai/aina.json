  "context": "The Finnish word 'aina' is an adverb that expresses the concept of perpetuity or continuous occurrence. It corresponds to English words like 'always,' 'constantly,' or 'continuously.' This word doesn't change form based on gender or number in Finnish as it's an adverb. In sentences, it typically appears before the verb it modifies, similar to many other adverbs in Finnish."
