  "context": "The word 'aina' in Finnish most commonly functions as an adverb meaning 'always'. It can also mean 'ever' or 'continually'.  It is derived from Proto-Finnic *aina and may have roots in Proto-Balto-Slavic. The word has different forms depending on the context, such as 'ainat' (plural nominative) and possessive forms like 'ainani' (my always). It can also refer to a fishing line, though this usage is less common."
