  "context": "The Finnish word 'puoli' most commonly means 'half'. It can also refer to a side of something, or an aspect/feature. The word declines depending on its use in the sentence; it has separate forms for singular and plural usage. When referring to two halves, the plural form is used. For example, 'puolet' means 'halves'."
