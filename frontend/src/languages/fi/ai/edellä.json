  "context": "The Finnish word 'edellä' is an adverb that means 'before', 'in front of', or 'ahead'. It indicates position in space (being physically before someone/something) or time (happening earlier). It's formed from the root 'edell-' which relates to being forward/frontward. In spatial contexts, it shows one person/object is positioned before another; in temporal contexts, it means something happens at an earlier time than reference point."
