  "context": "The word 'pimeä' in Finnish means 'dark'. It is an adjective that describes the absence of light. The word can also refer to doing something under-the-counter, or cash in hand, to avoid paying taxes. Additionally, it can be used colloquially to mean crazy or nuts. The declension shows how the word changes depending on its role in a sentence; for example 'pimeää' is the partitive form and 'pimeään' is the illative form."
