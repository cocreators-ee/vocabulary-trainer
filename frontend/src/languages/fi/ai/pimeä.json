  "context": "The Finnish word 'pimeä' means dark or dim. It's an adjective used to describe places that lack light or have very little illumination. In Finnish grammar, it's in the singular nominative form here. The comparative form would be 'pimeämpi' (darker) and superlative 'pimein' (darkest). It can also refer to darkness as a concept or state of being without light."
