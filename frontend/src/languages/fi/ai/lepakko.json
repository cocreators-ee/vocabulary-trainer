  "context": "The Finnish word 'lepakko' means bat in English. It is a noun referring to the flying mammal that is active at night. In Finnish, words ending with '-o' often become plural by adding '-t', so 'lepakot' would mean bats. Bats are commonly found attics or dark spaces and are known for their nocturnal habits and ability to fly."
