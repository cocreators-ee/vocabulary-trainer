  "context": "The Finnish word 'haju' refers to a smell or odour. It is a neutral term, but can sometimes imply an unpleasant scent. The word has many grammatical forms depending on the case and possession, as shown in the declension table.  It can also mean 'clue' or 'idea', as in the phrase 'Minulla ei ole hajuakaan...' which translates to 'I have no idea...'. The suffix '-u' is part of the basic form of the word, and the plural forms are indicated by '-t' at the end of the nominative case."
