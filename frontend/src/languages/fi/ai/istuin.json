  "context": "The word 'istuin' is a Finnish noun that means 'seat'. It can refer to any place designed for sitting, like a chair, bench, or even the papal seat. The word declines based on case and number; the provided form is the nominative singular. It also has possessive forms indicating who owns the seat (my seat, your seat, etc.). It's related to the verb 'istua', which means 'to sit'."
