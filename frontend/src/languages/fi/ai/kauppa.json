  "context": "The word 'kauppa' in Finnish can mean several things related to buying and selling. It commonly refers to a shop or store, but it can also refer to the act of trading or commerce itself. The plural form 'kaupat' is sometimes used informally for a single deal or transaction.  It comes from Proto-Finnic *kauppa, borrowed from Proto-Norse kaupa."
