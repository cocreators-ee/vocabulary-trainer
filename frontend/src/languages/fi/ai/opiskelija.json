  "context": "The Finnish word 'opiskelija' is a noun that refers to a person who studies, typically in an educational institution such as a university or college. It comes from the verb 'opiskella' (to study) and the suffix '-ja' which indicates a doer or agent of the action. The word can be used for students at any level of education but is most commonly associated with higher education. In Finnish, nouns have cases, so this word might appear in different forms depending on its grammatical role in a sentence (e.g., nominative case 'opiskelija', partitive case 'opiskelijaa', genitive case 'opiskelijan')."
