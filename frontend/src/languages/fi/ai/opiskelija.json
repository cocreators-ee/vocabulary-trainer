  "context": "The word 'opiskelija' in Finnish means 'student'. It refers to someone who is studying at a school or university. The word originates from the verb 'opiskella', which means 'to study'.  It declines based on grammatical case, with different forms for singular and plural, as well as possessive suffixes indicating whose student (e.g., my student, your student)."
