  "context": "The Finnish word 'outo' is an adjective that means strange, weird, or unfamiliar. It declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. The ending changes to reflect grammatical roles like nominative, genitive, partitive, etc., and whether it refers to a singular or plural subject. For example, 'oudon' is the genitive singular form, meaning 'of strange', while 'outoja' is the partitive plural form, meaning 'some strange things'. The suffix '-i' often indicates possession, as in 'outosi' which means 'your strange'."
