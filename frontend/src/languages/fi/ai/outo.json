  "context": "The Finnish word 'outo' is an adjective that means strange, odd, unusual, or peculiar. It's used to describe something or someone that seems abnormal, unfamiliar, or difficult to understand. The word can be modified for gender and number - 'outo' remains the same in basic form but would become 'oudon' in partitive case (e.g., 'outoa') or ' oudot' in plural nominative."
