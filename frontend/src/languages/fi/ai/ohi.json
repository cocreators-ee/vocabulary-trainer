  "context": "The word 'ohi' in Finnish can function as an adverb, postposition or preposition. As an adverb it means 'past' or 'beyond', indicating something has been passed. It can also mean 'over' when referring to something being finished or concluded. As a postposition, it indicates spatial relationships like 'by' or 'past'. The word does not take possessive suffixes; instead, 'ohitse' is used for those forms."
