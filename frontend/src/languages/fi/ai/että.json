  "context": "\"Että\" is a common Finnish conjunction that has multiple uses. It can introduce subordinate clauses (similar to 'that' in English), indicate cause-effect relationships (similar to 'because'), or serve as a connector between independent clauses (similar to 'so'). In its most common usage, it connects main clauses with subordinate clauses containing what someone says, thinks, believes, etc."
