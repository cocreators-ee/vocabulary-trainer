  "context": "The Finnish word 'segmentti' translates to 'segment' in English. It refers to a part or section of something, often used when dividing a whole into smaller pieces. The word is derived from Latin and is used across many fields like anatomy (brain segment), data analysis, and geometry.  It declines based on case and number; the provided declension table shows how it changes depending on its role in a sentence and whether it's singular or plural. For example, 'segmentti' is the nominative singular form, while 'segmentit' is the nominative plural."
