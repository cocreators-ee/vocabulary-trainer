  "context": "The word 'täysi' is an adjective in Finnish that means 'full'. It can refer to physical fullness, like a full glass of water ('täysi lasi vettä'), or completeness, like being completely skeptical ('täysi epäuskoon'). The word declines depending on its role in the sentence. For example, 'täyden' is the genitive form and 'täysissä' is the inessive plural form. It can also be used to express a state of being full, such as feeling satiated after a meal."
