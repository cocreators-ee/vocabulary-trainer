  "context": "The word 'tarjonta' in Finnish refers to the act of supplying something, or the things that are supplied. It can mean supply in an economic context (like supply and demand), but also more generally refer to a selection or range of items available. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence. For example, 'tarjontaa' is the partitive form, used for incomplete objects, while 'tarjonnan' is the genitive form often used to show possession or relation."
