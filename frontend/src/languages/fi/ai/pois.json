  "context": "The word 'pois' in Finnish is an adverb meaning 'away', 'off', or 'minus'. It indicates movement from a place, removal of something, or subtraction in mathematics. The word can also be used to soften the force of an imperative, similar to saying 'just' before a command. It comes from the root 'poikki-' and has various inflections depending on its grammatical case."
