  "context": "The word 'kissa' in Finnish means 'cat'. It is a common noun and can refer to domestic cats (Felis catus). The declension shows how the word changes depending on its grammatical role in a sentence. For example, 'kissat' is the plural form meaning 'cats', and possessive forms like 'kissani' mean 'my cat'. There are also diminutives such as 'mirri' for a smaller or cuter cat."
