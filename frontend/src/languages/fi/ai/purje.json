  "context": "The word 'purje' in Finnish primarily means 'sail', referring to the piece of fabric attached to a boat that catches the wind. It can also colloquially mean 'rag' or 'sheet'. The declension shows how the word changes based on its grammatical role in a sentence, and possessive forms indicate ownership (e.g., my sail, your sail)."
