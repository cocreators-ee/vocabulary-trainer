  "context": "The Finnish word 'kiire' is a noun that means 'haste,' 'rush,' or 'urgency.' It can refer to being in a hurry, having many tasks to complete quickly, or the pressure of time constraints. In Finnish, it's often used with the partitive case when referring to multiple instances (e.g., 'kiireitä' for 'many hastes/rushes'), and can also be adjectivally as 'kiireinen' meaning 'busy' or 'hectic.'"
