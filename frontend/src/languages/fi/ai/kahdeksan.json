  "context": "The word 'kahdeksan' is the basic numeral for the number eight in Finnish. It belongs to a group of numbers that have unique forms and declensions, as detailed in the dictionary definition. The colloquial form 'kasi' is also commonly used when counting.  It declines based on its grammatical case; the nominative singular and genitive singular are identical ('kahdeksan'). You can see plural forms like 'kahdeksat'. It’s part of a larger system of Finnish numbers, related to Proto-Finnic roots."
