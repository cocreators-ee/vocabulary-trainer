  "context": "The Finnish word 'nimi' means 'name' in English. It is a common noun used to refer to the name of a person, place, thing, or concept. In Finnish, nouns have grammatical cases, so 'nimi' can appear in different forms depending on its function in a sentence - for example, 'nimesi' (your name), 'nimemme' (our name), and 'hänen nimensä' (his/her name)."
