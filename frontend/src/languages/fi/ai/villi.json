  "context": "The word 'villi' in Finnish means wild, savage or untamed. It is an adjective that can describe animals, plants, or even people. The word declines depending on the case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'villit' is the plural nominative form meaning 'wild ones'. The possessive forms are also complex, indicating who owns something wild (e.g., 'villini' means 'my wild one')."
