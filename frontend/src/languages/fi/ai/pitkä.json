  "context": "The Finnish word 'pitkä' is an adjective that means 'long' in English. It can refer to physical length (a long road, tall height), duration of time (a long day), or extended periods. The word changes form depending on the case and gender it modifies - for example, 'pitkä' remains the same for masculine singular nominative but becomes 'pitkät' in plural form. It's a common adjective used to describe dimensions that extend significantly."
