  "context": "Kolmio is a Finnish word that primarily means 'triangle'. It can also refer to a three-room apartment (informally) or a yield sign. The word comes from the Finnish word for 'three', kolme, and has various inflections depending on its grammatical case. For example, kolmion refers to the genitive form of the word, meaning 'of a triangle'. It also has possessive forms like kolmioni (my triangle) or kolmiosi (your triangle)."
