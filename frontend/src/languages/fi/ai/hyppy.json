  "context": "The word 'hyppy' in Finnish refers to the act of jumping or hopping. It can also mean a leap, especially in sports contexts like gymnastics (where it translates to vault) or skiing (mäkihyppy = ski jump). The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, indicating its role within a sentence. For example, 'hyppyni' means 'my jump', and 'hyppyjemme' means 'our jumps'. It can also refer to networking hops when talking about data packets."
