  "context": "The Finnish word 'numero' generally refers to a digit or number used for sequencing, identification, or as part of a code. It is often used in contexts where the number doesn’t represent a quantity but rather a position or label, like phone numbers or product codes. In contrast, 'luku' is typically used when referring to a numerical value representing a count or amount. The word declines based on case and possession, as shown in the dictionary definitions."
