  "context": "The word 'sade' in Finnish refers to precipitation of any kind, but most commonly it means rain. It can also refer to other forms of precipitation like snow or hail, often with a modifier (e.g., lumisade for snowfall). The word declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show various forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as possessive forms indicating who owns the 'sade'. For example, 'sateeni' means 'my rain'."
