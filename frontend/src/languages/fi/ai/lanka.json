  "context": "The Finnish word 'lanka' refers to a twisted strand of fiber used for sewing, weaving, or knitting. It can also refer to metal wire or even an internet thread (as in a series of messages on a forum). The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definitions, indicating its role in a sentence. For example, 'langan' is the genitive form meaning 'of the thread', and 'lankaa' is the partitive form."
