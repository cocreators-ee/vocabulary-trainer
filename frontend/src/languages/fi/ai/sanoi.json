  "context": "The Finnish word 'sanoi' is the third person singular past tense form of the verb 'sanoa', which means 'to say' or 'to speak'. It is commonly used when referring to what someone has said in the past. This form follows the regular consonant gradation pattern where the stem 'san-' loses its final consonant in the basic form but gains it back in the past tense."
