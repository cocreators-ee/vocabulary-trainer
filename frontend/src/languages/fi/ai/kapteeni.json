  "context": "The word 'kapteeni' in Finnish means 'captain'. It is used for the commander of a sea-going vessel, an aircraft, or as a military rank. The word originates from Swedish 'kapten', which comes from Old French and Late Latin roots.  It declines based on case; for example, 'kapteenin' is the genitive form meaning 'of the captain'. It can also be used in plural forms like 'kapteenit' (captains)."
