  "context": "The Finnish word 'jossa' is an inessive form of the relative pronoun 'joka', meaning 'which' or 'that'. It indicates location within a place and functions as a conjunction introducing relative clauses. The -ssa/-ssä suffix indicates the inessive case, showing being inside or within something. It's commonly used to specify locations within larger entities like buildings, cities, or abstract spaces."
