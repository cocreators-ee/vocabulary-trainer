  "context": "The Finnish word 'iso' is an adjective that means big, large or great. It can refer to physical size, as in a 'big dog', but also to importance or extent. The word declines depending on the case and number of the noun it modifies. For example, 'ison' is the genitive singular form (meaning 'of a big'), while 'isot' is the nominative plural ('big ones')."
