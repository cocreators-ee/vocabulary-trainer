  "context": "The word 'huopa' in Finnish refers to felt or a blanket made of felt. It is derived from Proto-Finnic and has cognates in other Finno-Ugric languages like Ingrian and Karelian. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural, nominative, genitive, partitive, and so on. Possessive suffixes are also added to indicate ownership (e.g., 'huopani' means 'my blanket')."
