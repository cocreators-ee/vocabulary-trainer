  "context": "The word 'pituus' in Finnish refers to the measurement of something along its longest dimension. It can mean length (of an object), height (of a person), or longitude (in geography). The noun declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural, and possessive suffixes indicating who owns the length being measured. For example, 'pituuteni' means 'my length/height'. The suffix '-uus' indicates a quality or state of being long."
