  "context": "The Finnish word 'valmis' is an adjective that means 'ready', 'finished', or 'completed'. It can also mean 'prepared'. The word declines based on case, and the essive form 'valmiina' is often used when something is about to happen.  It’s frequently found in compound words indicating a pre-made state, like 'valmisbetoni' (ready-made concrete) or 'valmismatka' (pre-booked trip)."
