  "context": "The word 'sormi' in Finnish means 'finger'. It refers to one of the five extremities of the hand. The declension shows different forms depending on its grammatical role in a sentence, such as nominative (sormi), genitive (sormen), and partitive (sormea). Possessive forms also exist to indicate ownership, like 'sormeni' meaning 'my finger'. It is a common noun with no gradation."
