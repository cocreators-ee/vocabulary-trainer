  "context": "The Finnish word 'näkymä' is a noun that refers to what can be seen from a particular place - the view, sight, or vista. It's derived from the verb 'nähdä' (to see) and indicates something that is visible or observable. The word can refer to physical views like landscapes as well as more abstract concepts of how things appear or seem."
