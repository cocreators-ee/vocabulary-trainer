  "context": "The word 'helppous' in Finnish refers to the state or quality of being easy. It is a noun that describes how simple and effortless something is, or how readily achievable it may be. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.).  The suffix '-us' turns the adjective 'helppo' (easy) into a noun meaning easiness or simplicity. It can also be used to indicate possession, for example 'helppouteni' means 'my ease'. The plural form is 'helppoudet'."
