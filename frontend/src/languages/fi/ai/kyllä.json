  "context": "The Finnish word 'kyllä' is a versatile term that functions as both an adverb and an interjection. As an adverb, it serves as an intensifier, similar to the English auxiliary 'do' in many cases ('I did go there'). It can also mean 'enough' or 'sufficiently', though this usage is archaic. More commonly, 'kyllä' is used as an interjection meaning 'yes'. While traditionally responses were given by repeating the verb (echo response), using 'kyllä' as a direct affirmation has become increasingly common, especially since the 20th century."
