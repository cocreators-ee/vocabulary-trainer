  "context": "The word 'rannikolla' is an inessive case form of 'rannikko', meaning 'coast'. The '-lla' suffix indicates location ('in/at/on'), so 'rannikolla' specifically means 'on the coast' or 'by the sea'. It's used to describe being physically located on the coastal area. The word is commonly used when referring to vacation spots, beaches, or seaside activities in Finnish."
