  "context": "The Finnish word 'rakas' is an adjective that means dear, beloved, or cherished. It can also be used as a noun meaning darling or sweetheart. The word declines based on case and number, with different forms for singular and plural subjects and possessors. For example, 'rakkaani' means 'my love'. The suffix '-mme' indicates possession by 'we', so 'juhlamme' would mean 'our celebration'."
