  "context": "The Finnish word 'aste' primarily means 'degree' and is commonly used to measure temperature (e.g., astetta pakkasta = degrees of frost/cold), angles, or academic qualifications. It can also refer to a step or level in progression, similar to English 'step'. In academic contexts, it may refer to educational degrees like bachelor's or master's degrees."
