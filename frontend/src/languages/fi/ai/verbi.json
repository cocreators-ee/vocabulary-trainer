  "context": "The word 'verbi' is a Finnish noun that means 'verb'. In Finnish grammar, it refers to words that express actions, states, or occurrences. Like in English, verbs are essential components of sentences as they indicate what the subject is doing or being. The form of the verb changes depending on tense (past, present, future), mood, person, and number."
