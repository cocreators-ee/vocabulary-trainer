  "context": "The word 'lopullinen' is an adjective meaning final, ultimate, or definitive. It indicates something that is conclusive and not subject to change. The -llinen suffix turns the noun 'loppu' (end) into an adjective.  It declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show nominative, genitive, partitive, and other cases for both singular and plural forms. Possessive forms are also available, indicating who owns something that is final."
