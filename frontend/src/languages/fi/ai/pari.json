  "context": "The word 'pari' in Finnish generally means a pair or couple of something. It can refer to physical pairs like socks ('sukka pari'), romantic couples ('aviopari'), or even just approximately two of something, as in 'a couple of times'. The word declines based on grammatical case, and possessive forms exist to indicate ownership. It is also used in card games to mean a pair of cards with the same rank."
