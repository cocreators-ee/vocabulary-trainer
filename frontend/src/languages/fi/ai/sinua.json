  "context": "The word 'sinua' is the partitive form of 'sinä' (you, singular). In Finnish grammar, the partitive case has multiple uses including indicating partiality or indefiniteness. When used with verbs like auttaa (help), rakastaa (love) or ajatella (think about), it indicates the recipient or target of the action in a way that differs from the accusative case. This form is commonly used when referring to a person who is receiving an action, especially with certain verb constructions."
