  "context": "The word 'tuki' in Finnish can have multiple meanings depending on the context. It most commonly refers to physical support, like a prop or crutch, but it also means emotional, financial, or political backing. It can even refer to social benefits or allowances provided by the government. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and possessive forms exist to indicate who is providing or receiving the support."
