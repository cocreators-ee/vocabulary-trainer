  "context": "The Finnish word 'saattaa' is versatile. It can function as a modal verb meaning 'may', 'might', or 'could' when expressing possibility, similar to English modals. In its base form it also means 'to take someone/somewhere' or 'to escort'. As causative form of 'tulla' (to come), it means 'to cause to come' or 'to have someone come'. This dual nature makes it very common in everyday Finnish speech."
