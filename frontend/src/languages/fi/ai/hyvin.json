  "context": "The Finnish word 'hyvin' is an adverb that means 'well' or 'very'. It's commonly used to indicate the quality of an action (how well something is done) or as an intensifier to mean 'very' when modifying adjectives. In colloquial speech, it can also serve as a standalone response meaning 'good' or 'fine'. Its usage varies depending on context - with verbs it modifies how the action is performed, while with adjectives it intensifies their degree."
