  "context": "The Finnish word 'ja' most commonly translates to 'and' in English. It is a coordinating conjunction used to connect words, phrases, or clauses. The dictionary definitions show that it originates from Proto-Finnic and has cognates in other Finnic languages like Estonian and Ingrian. While primarily meaning 'and', it can also have dialectal uses as 'also' or 'as well'.  It is rarely inflected but possessive forms exist when used as part of a compound word, such as JA-portti ('AND gate')."
