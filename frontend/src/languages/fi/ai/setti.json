  "context": "The Finnish word 'setti' generally refers to a collection of various objects that belong together for a particular purpose. It can be translated as 'set', 'collection', or 'kit'.  It is an informal term, and can also refer to a receiver like a television set. The word declines based on case; the provided dictionary definitions show how it changes in different grammatical contexts (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). It can also be used with possessive suffixes indicating who owns the 'setti' (e.g., 'settini' means 'my set')."
