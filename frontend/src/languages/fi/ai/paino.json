  "context": "The word 'paino' in Finnish can refer to several things, including physical weight (force due to gravity), a printing press, or a sinker used in fishing. It can also mean stress (though this usage is obsolete). The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definitions, and possessive suffixes are added to indicate ownership. For example, 'painoni' means 'my weight'. The plural form is 'painot'."
