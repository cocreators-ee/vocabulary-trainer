  "context": "Sokeri is the Finnish word for sugar. It's a noun that declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition. The nominative singular form is 'sokeri', meaning 'sugar'. You can see different forms like 'sokerin' (genitive) and 'sokeria' (partitive).  The possessive forms also change depending on who owns the sugar – for example, 'sokerini' means 'my sugar'. The word originates from Swedish 'socker', which in turn comes from Middle Low German and Italian."
