  "context": "The Finnish word 'itse' is an adverb that can function in several ways: 1) As a reflexive pronoun meaning 'oneself', similar to English oneself, used when the subject and object are the same; 2) To emphasize personal involvement or action, similar to 'personally' or 'in person'; 3) In certain constructions like 'itse asiassa' (actually/in fact), where it serves as an intensifier. The word can appear in different forms depending on context and sentence structure."
