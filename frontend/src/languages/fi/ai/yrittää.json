  "context": "The Finnish word 'yrittää' means 'to try', 'attempt', or 'endeavor'. It is a transitive verb, often used with the first infinitive to indicate what someone is trying to do. The form 'yrittävät' indicates the third-person plural present tense ('they try'). The dictionary definition shows that it comes from older Finnish roots related to starting something and may have North Germanic influences.  The word can also be conjugated into different tenses, as shown in the provided conjugation table."
