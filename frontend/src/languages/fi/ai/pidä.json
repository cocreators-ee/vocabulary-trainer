  "context": "The word 'pidä' is a form of the verb 'pitää', which means 'to hold', 'to keep', or 'to like'. It can also mean 'to maintain' something. In this case, it's the second-person singular present active imperative connegative, meaning it's used to tell someone what to do (in a negative sense), and is conjugated for 'you'. The sentences show examples of using 'pidä' in different contexts: liking someone ('I like you'), telling someone to take care ('Take care of yourself!'), and asking if something should be kept secret ('Do you want to keep this a secret?')."
