  "context": "The Finnish word 'tiede' translates to 'science' in English. It refers to a collective discipline of learning, encompassing both the liberal arts and humanities, as well as natural sciences. Unlike the modern usage of 'science', it doesn’t exclusively refer to natural sciences; 'luonnontiede' is used for those specifically. The word can be singular (generic term or specific discipline) or plural ('tieteet', collectively). It comes from the verb 'tietää' meaning 'to know'. The declension shows how the word changes based on its grammatical role in a sentence, and possessive forms indicate who owns or studies the science."
