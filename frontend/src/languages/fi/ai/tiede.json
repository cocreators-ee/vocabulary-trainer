  "context": "The Finnish word 'tiede' primarily means 'science' or 'knowledge'. It refers to systematic study of the natural world through observation and experimentation. The word is used in academic contexts but also more generally to refer to knowledge-based inquiry and understanding. In its basic form, it's a feminine noun that can take various endings depending on context (tiede -> tiedeet in plural, tieteen in genitive case)."
