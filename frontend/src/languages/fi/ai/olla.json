  "context": "The Finnish word 'olla' is the basic verb meaning 'to be'. It's an irregular verb that changes its form depending on the subject. In singular first person (I), it becomesolen'; in singular second person (you), it's 'olet'; in singular third person (he/she/it), it's 'on'; and in plural forms, it appears as 'olemme' (we), 'olette' (you pl.), or 'ovat' (they). This verb is essential for expressing existence and identity in Finnish."
