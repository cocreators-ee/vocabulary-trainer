  "context": "The Finnish verb 'olla' is the copulative verb meaning 'to be'. It’s used to indicate a state of being or existence, and connects the subject with its complement. The forms 'on' and 'ovat' are irregular.  It also has many other uses including forming perfect tenses (with past participles) and expressing possession ('Minulla on kissa' - I have a cat). It is often used in impersonal constructions to express existence ('Pöydällä on kissa' - There is a cat on the table)."
