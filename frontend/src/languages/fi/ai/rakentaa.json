  "context": "The Finnish verb 'rakentaa' means 'to build' or 'to construct'. It is a transitive verb, meaning it takes an object. The illative case (or sometimes allative) is used to indicate the location *to* which something is being built. For example, 'Rakennan talon rannalle' means 'I am building the house to the shore'. The word can be conjugated in various tenses and moods as shown in the dictionary definition."
