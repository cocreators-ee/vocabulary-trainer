  "context": "The Finnish word 'se' is a demonstrative pronoun with multiple uses. It can mean 'that', 'it', or even 'he/she' in colloquial contexts. The form of the word changes depending on its grammatical case (nominative, genitive, etc.).  It also functions as a determiner meaning 'that'. In some dialects it is used as a personal pronoun instead of 'hän'."
