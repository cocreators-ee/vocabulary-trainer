  "context": "The Finnish word 'se' is a demonstrative pronoun that means 'it', 'that', or can refer to 'he/she'. It's used to point to something previously mentioned or to identify an object. As a third-person singular pronoun, it has different forms depending on the gender and case of the noun it replaces: 'hän' for masculine/feminine subjects (meaning 'he/she'), and 'se' for inanimate objects and sometimes animals."
