  "context": "The word 'tauko' in Finnish means a break, pause or rest. It can refer to an interruption in something like speech or work, or a musical rest. The word declines depending on its role in the sentence; for example, 'tauon' is the genitive form meaning 'of the break', and 'taukoa' is the partitive form often used when referring to taking a break. It can also be used in possessive forms like 'taukoni' (my break)."
