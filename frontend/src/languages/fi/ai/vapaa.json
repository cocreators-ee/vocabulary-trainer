  "context": "The Finnish word 'vapaa' is a versatile adjective with multiple meanings related to freedom and lack of constraint. It can mean 'free' in the sense of not being imprisoned or enslaved, 'free' as in having permission or liberty to do something, 'free' as in unoccupied or available (like time or a seat), or even 'loose' when referring to something that has been released. The word declines depending on its grammatical role in the sentence; for example, 'vapaa' is the nominative singular form, while 'vapaita' is the partitive plural form. It also appears in compound words and possessive forms."
