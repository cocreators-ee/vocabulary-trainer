  "context": "The word 'musta' is an adjective meaning 'black' in Finnish. It declines depending on the case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. It can also refer to a person, though it's important to be aware of potentially offensive connotations when referring to people (see synonyms like 'neekeri', which are considered racist). The word is often used to describe color but can also have other uses."
