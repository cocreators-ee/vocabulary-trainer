  "context": "In Finnish, 'pohja' is a versatile noun that can mean base, foundation, bottom, ground, origin, or source depending on the context. It's commonly used to describe the lowest part of something (like the bottom of a container), the fundamental support structure (foundation/base), or the starting point/source of something. The word doesn't change form in these different contexts - it remains 'pohja' regardless of whether it's referring to physical bases, abstract foundations, or origins."
