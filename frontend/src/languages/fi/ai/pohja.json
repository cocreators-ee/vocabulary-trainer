  "context": "The word 'pohja' in Finnish translates to 'bottom', 'base', or 'foundation' in English. It refers to the lowest part of something, a place where things rest, or the underlying principle of an idea. The word can be inflected depending on its role in the sentence; for example, 'pohjan' is the genitive form meaning 'of the bottom/base/foundation'.  The plural nominative is 'pohjat', and the partitive is 'pohjaa'. It also has archaic meanings like 'north'."
