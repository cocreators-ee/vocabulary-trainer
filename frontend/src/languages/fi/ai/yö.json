  "context": "The word 'yö' in Finnish means 'night'. It refers to the period of darkness when people typically sleep. The concepts of 'ilta' (evening) and 'yö' are slightly different in Finnish than in English, with 'yö' generally referring to the hours between 10/11 p.m. and 6/7 a.m.  The word declines based on case; for example, 'yöllä' means 'at night'. It can also be used in compound words like 'aamuyö' (morning night), which would be referred to as 'Monday night' in English."
