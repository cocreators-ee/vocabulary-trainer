  "context": "The word 'lomake' in Finnish refers to a blank document or template that needs to be filled in by the user. It can also simply mean 'form'. The word is derived from 'loma', meaning 'gap', as forms contain gaps to be filled.  It declines based on case, with different endings indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). There are also possessive forms showing who owns the form ('lomakkeeni' - my form, 'lomakkeesi' - your form and so on)."
