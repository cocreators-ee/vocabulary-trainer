  "context": "The Finnish verb 'kertoa' primarily means 'to tell'. It is a very common and versatile word. It can be used transitively with the allative case to indicate *who* is being told something ('kertoa jollekin', to tell someone). It also appears in many idiomatic expressions, such as 'Huhu kertoo...' (Rumour has it...). The form 'kertovat' is the 3rd person plural present tense, meaning 'they tell'.  The word originates from 'kerta' which means time or occasion and shares roots with words like 'recount' in English. It can also mean to multiply."
