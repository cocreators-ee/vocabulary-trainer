  "context": "The word 'oma' in Finnish means 'own'. It is a possessive adjective indicating that something belongs to someone. It can also mean 'friendly' in a military context, referring to those on one’s own side. The word declines based on the person and number of the possessor, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'omani' means 'my', 'omasi' means 'your', and 'omamme' means 'our'. It can also be used as a noun meaning 'friendlies'."
