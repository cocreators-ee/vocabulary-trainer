  "context": "The word 'taas' is a Finnish adverb that means 'again', 'another time', or 'once again'. It indicates repetition of an action or event. The dictionary definitions show it as the s-lative singular form of 'taka-', but it’s commonly used and understood as an independent adverb.  It can also be used to emphasize a contrast, like 'but I for one...' as shown in the example sentence."
