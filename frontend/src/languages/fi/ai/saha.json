  "context": "The word 'saha' in Finnish means 'saw'. It is a tool used for cutting wood or other hard materials. The noun declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.).  It can also refer to a musical saw. Possessive suffixes are added to indicate who owns the saw (e.g., 'sahamme' means 'our saw')."
