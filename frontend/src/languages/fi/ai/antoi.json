  "context": "The word 'antoi' is the third-person singular past indicative form of the verb 'antaa', which means 'to give'. It translates to 'gave', 'granted', or 'provided' in English. Because it is a past tense form, it indicates an action that has already happened and was performed by a single subject (he/she/it)."
