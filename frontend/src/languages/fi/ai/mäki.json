  "context": "The Finnish word 'mäki' refers to a hill, specifically a relatively large rounded elevation of earth. It is larger than 'kukkula' (small hill) but smaller than 'vuori' (mountain). The word declines in various forms depending on its grammatical role in the sentence, as shown in the dictionary definition.  The possessive suffixes indicate who owns or is associated with the hill; for example, 'mäkeni' means 'my hill'. It can also be used to describe a slope or hillside."
