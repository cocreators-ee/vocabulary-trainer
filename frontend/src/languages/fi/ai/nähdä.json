  "context": "The Finnish word 'nähdä' is a versatile verb meaning 'to see'. It can be used literally to describe perceiving something with your eyes, but also figuratively to mean 'to meet' someone or 'to realize' something. The dictionary definitions show that it conjugates in various tenses and moods, including present, past, conditional, imperative, and potential.  The word is part of a larger family of words related to vision and perception, as shown by the cognates listed (Karelian 'nähä', Estonian 'nägema' etc.). Colloquially, the present stem can be shortened from 'näe-' to 'nää-', for example 'näen' becomes 'nään'."
