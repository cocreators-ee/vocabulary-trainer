  "context": "The Finnish word 'molemmat' means 'both'. It is used only in plural forms, with the singular form 'molempi' appearing mostly in compounds. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'molempien' is the genitive form meaning 'of both', and 'molemmissa' is the inessive form meaning 'in both'. It can function as a pronoun or determiner."
