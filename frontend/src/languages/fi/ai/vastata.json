  "context": "The Finnish verb 'vastata' means 'to answer', 'to reply', or 'to respond'. It is an intransitive verb, often used with the illative case to indicate what is being answered *to* (e.g., kysymykseen - to a question). The word originates from Proto-Finnic and has semantic connections to Swedish and French roots related to responsibility and accountability.  The conjugation shows various tenses and moods, including present, past, conditional, imperative, and potential. It can also mean 'to be responsible for' or 'to correspond to'. The form 'vastasivat' indicates the third-person plural past tense ('they answered')."
