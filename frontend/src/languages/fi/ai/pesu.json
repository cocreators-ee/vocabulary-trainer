  "context": "The word 'pesu' in Finnish refers to the act of washing, or laundry. It can be a noun meaning 'wash' or 'washing', and it is related to the verb 'pestä' which means 'to wash'. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms indicating who owns the laundry (e.g., 'pesuni' - my washing) or where something is being washed (e.g., 'pesussa' - in the laundry). It can also be used to describe specific types of washing like 'aamupesu' which means morning wash."
