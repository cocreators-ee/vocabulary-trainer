  "context": "The Finnish word 'kiireinen' is an adjective meaning busy, hectic, or rushed. It describes a state where there is much to do in little time, often resulting in pressure and lack of free time. The word comes from the root 'kiire' (hurry), and when used as 'kiireisin', it becomes the superlative form meaning 'the busiest'."
