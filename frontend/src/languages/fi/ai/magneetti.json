  "context": "The word 'magneetti' in Finnish means 'magnet'. It is a noun that refers to an object or material that produces a magnetic field. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural, nominative, genitive, partitive, and other cases. For example, 'magneetti' is the nominative singular form, while 'magneetit' is the nominative plural form. Possessive suffixes are also added to indicate ownership (e.g., 'magneettini' means 'my magnet')."
