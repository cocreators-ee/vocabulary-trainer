  "context": "The Finnish word 'kiinni' is a versatile adverb with multiple meanings. It can mean 'closed', as in 'Ovi oli kiinni' (The door was closed). It also signifies being 'attached' or 'connected', like 'Vene on kiinni laiturissa' (The boat is moored to the quay).  Additionally, it can indicate someone being 'busy' or unavailable. The word can also express 'up to' in the sense of depending on something or someone, as in 'Se ei ole minusta kiinni' (That isn't up to me). It originates from Proto-Finnic *kindik and is related to the word 'kiinteä' which means solid."
