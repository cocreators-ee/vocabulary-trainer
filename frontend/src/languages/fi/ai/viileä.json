It most commonly means 'cool' in temperature, like a slightly cold or refreshing feeling. However, it also has colloquial uses meaning 'cool' as in stylish or popular, and can even mean 'lukewarm' or 'unenthusiastic'. The word declines based on case; for example, 'viileän' is the genitive singular form, while 'viileät' is the nominative plural. It’s related to words like 'kylmä' (cold) and 'vilpoinen' (cool)."
