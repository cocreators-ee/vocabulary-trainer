  "context": "The word 'polku' in Finnish means 'path', 'trail', or 'track'. It refers to a route for walking or traveling. The noun declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.).  The plural form is 'polut'. You can also see possessive suffixes like '-ni' meaning 'my path', '-si' for 'your path', and so on."
