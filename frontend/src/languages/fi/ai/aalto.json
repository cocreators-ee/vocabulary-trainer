  "context": "The word 'aalto' refers to a wave, typically on the surface of water. It can also be used figuratively to describe an advancing increase in something, like a 'wave of bankruptcies'. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and has different forms depending on whether it is singular or plural. For example, 'aallot' means 'waves', and possessive forms exist to indicate ownership (e.g., 'aaltoni' - my wave)."
