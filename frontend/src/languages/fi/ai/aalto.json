  "context": "In Finnish, 'aalto' means wave and refers to a raised ridge of water that moves across the surface of an ocean, lake, or other body of water. It can also be used more broadly to describe any undulating movement or pattern, similar to how it might be used in English for things like radio waves or sound waves."
