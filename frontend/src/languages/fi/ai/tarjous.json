  "context": "The word 'tarjous' in Finnish means 'offer', 'bid', or 'tender'. It is a noun that refers to a proposal or expression of willingness to perform a service or provide goods at a certain price. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.).  The possessive forms indicate who is making the offer ('my offer', 'your offer', 'our offer' and so on). For example, 'tarjouksemme' means 'our offer'."
