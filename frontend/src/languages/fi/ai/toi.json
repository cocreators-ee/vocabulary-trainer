  "context": "'Toi' is a Finnish demonstrative pronoun that means 'that'. It's used to point something out as being at a distance from the speaker. The word can be declined in different ways depending on its grammatical function - it might appear as 'tuo', 'tuon', 'tuossa', etc., but 'toi' is an informal or colloquial form often found in speech."
