  "context": "The word 'totta' in Finnish can function as an interjection meaning 'true', used to confirm something. It also serves as the partitive singular form of the noun 'tosi', which means 'truth'. Therefore, it can appear in sentences indicating someone is speaking truthfully or acknowledging a fact as being true."
