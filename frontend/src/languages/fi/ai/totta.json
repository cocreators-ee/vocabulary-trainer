  "context": "In Finnish, 'totta' is an adverb that expresses truthfulness or confirmation. It can be used as a standalone response meaning 'yes', 'true', or 'really'. In the phrase 'totta kai', it means 'of course' or 'certainly'. The word derives from the noun 'totuus' (truth) and is commonly used in everyday Finnish to affirm statements."
