  "context": "The Finnish word 'toinen' is a versatile adjective and pronoun that functions as both 'another' and 'second'. It can be used to indicate something additional (like 'another') or specifically the second item in a sequence. In plural form, 'toiset', it means 'others' or 'some people'. The word changes its form based on case and number - it's 'toinen' for singular nominative, 'toisen' for partitive/illative cases, and 'toisessa' for inessive case (in/on another)."
