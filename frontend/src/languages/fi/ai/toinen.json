  "context": "The word 'toinen' in Finnish means 'second', 'another', or 'other'. It is a versatile adjective and pronoun used for indicating sequence, alternatives, or different entities. The form 'toinen' is the nominative singular form.  It declines based on case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'toisessa' means 'in the second', and 'toisena' means 'as the second'. It can also be used to refer to one of two things, like 'one...the other'."
