  "context": "The Finnish verb 'opettaa' means to teach, instruct or educate someone. It's a regular verb that follows the basic conjugation pattern for -aa ending verbs. In infinitive form it is 'opettaa', and when teaching something (the object of teaching) the partitive case is typically used with it, as shown in the examples where different subjects are being taught."
