  "context": "The Finnish word 'opettaa' means 'to teach'. It is a transitive verb, meaning it requires an object (what is being taught) and often takes the allative case to indicate who or what is being taught. The word comes from Proto-Finnic roots related to learning ('oppia').  It can be conjugated in various tenses and moods as shown in the dictionary definition."
