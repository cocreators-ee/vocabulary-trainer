  "context": "The word 'oli' is the third-person singular past indicative form of the verb 'olla', which means 'to be'. It translates to 'was' in English. Because Finnish verbs conjugate based on person and tense, 'oli' specifically indicates that something *was* (singular subject) at some point in the past. The word can also translate to 'were' depending on context."
