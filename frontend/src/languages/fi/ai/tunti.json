  "context": "The word 'tunti' in Finnish means 'hour', referring to a unit of time. It can also mean 'lesson' or 'class'. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, and possessive suffixes indicating who owns the hour (e.g., my hour - tuntini)."
