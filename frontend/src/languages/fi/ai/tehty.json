  "context": "Tehty is the past participle form of the Finnish verb 'tehdä', which means 'to make' or 'to do'. It's used to indicate that something has been made, done, completed, or created. The word follows a consonant gradation pattern common in Finnish grammar where the 't' changes to 'tt' in certain forms."
