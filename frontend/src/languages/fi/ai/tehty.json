  "context": "The word 'tehty' is the past passive participle of the verb 'tehdä', which means 'to do' or 'to make'. It translates to 'done', 'made', or 'finished' depending on the context. The form indicates that something *has been* done, made, or finished by someone.  The dictionary definitions show a lot of different cases for this word, as Finnish is an inflected language and changes based on its role in the sentence. For example, 'tehdyt' is the plural nominative form meaning 'done/made', while 'tehtyni' means 'my done/made'. The possessive forms indicate who did the doing or making."
