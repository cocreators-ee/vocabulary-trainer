  "context": "The Finnish word 'peloissaan' is an adverbial form derived from the noun 'pelko' (fear). It's in the elative case ('-ssa' suffix), which indicates location or state. The construction follows the pattern where a noun becomes an adverb by adding '-ssa/-ss채'. When someone is 'peloissaan', they are experiencing fear, anxiety, or being scared of something specific. This form emphasizes their current emotional state of being afraid."
