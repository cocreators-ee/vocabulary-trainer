  "context": "The word 'peloissaan' is a Finnish adverb meaning 'afraid', 'terrified', or 'frightened'. It is the inessive plural form of 'pelko' (fear) with a possessive suffix. The '-ssaan' ending indicates that someone *is* in a state of fear.  It can be used predicatively with the verb 'olla' (to be), as in 'Hän oli peloissaan' (He/She was afraid). It also has personal/possessive forms, indicating who is feeling the fear ('peloissani' - I am afraid, 'peloissanne' - you are afraid, etc.)."
