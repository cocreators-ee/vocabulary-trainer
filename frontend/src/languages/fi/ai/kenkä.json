  "context": "The word 'kenkä' in Finnish means 'shoe'. It is a common noun and can refer to various types of shoes, including boots. The dictionary definitions show the different forms it takes based on grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) and possessive suffixes (my shoe, your shoe, our shoe etc.). For example, 'kengät' is the plural form meaning 'shoes', while 'kenkäni' means 'my shoe'."
