  "context": "The Finnish word 'kenkä' means shoe in English. It is a singular noun referring to one individual shoe. In Finnish, 'kenkä' belongs to the weak declension class for consonant stems, which affects how it forms its plural and other grammatical cases. For example, the plural form is 'kengät'. The word can be combined with various suffixes to express different relationships, such as location ('kenkässä' - in a shoe), possession ('kenkäni' - my shoe), or composition ('nahkakenkä' - leather shoe)."
