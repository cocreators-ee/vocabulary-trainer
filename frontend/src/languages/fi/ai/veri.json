  "context": "The Finnish word 'veri' means blood. It can also refer to family relationships or someone’s temper, though the primary meaning is the liquid flowing in bodies. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'veren' is the genitive form (of blood), and 'verta' is the partitive form (some blood).  The possessive forms change depending on who owns the blood - e.g., 'vereni' means my blood."
