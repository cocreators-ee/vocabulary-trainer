  "context": "The Finnish word 'kerran' is a versatile word with multiple meanings. It functions as an adverb meaning 'once', indicating something happened only one time. It can also be used in the phrase 'Olipa kerran...' which is the traditional way to start a story, equivalent to 'Once upon a time...'. Additionally, it can act as a noun (genitive singular of 'kerta' - time) and emphasize a reason or cause, similar to 'since' or 'because', often used with conjunctions like 'kun'. The word is related to the noun 'kerta' which means 'time'."
