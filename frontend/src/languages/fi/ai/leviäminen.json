  "context": "Leviäminen is a verbal noun derived from the verb 'levitä', which means 'to spread'. It refers to the process of something expanding or becoming widely distributed. The word can be used in various contexts, such as the spread of diseases, information, or fires. As indicated by the dictionary definition, it declines like a typical Finnish noun of type 38/nainen and has different forms depending on its grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) and possessor."
