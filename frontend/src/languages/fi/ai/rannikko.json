  "context": "The Finnish word 'rannikko' means coastline, shore or seacoast. It refers to the land adjacent to a sea or ocean, particularly the edge where land meets water. In Finnish grammar, 'rannikko' is in the nominative singular form here. When used with the '-lla' suffix (as in 'rannikolla'), it indicates location meaning 'on the coast'. The word can also appear in other cases such as genitive ('rannikon') indicating possession or association, meaning 'of the coast' or 'coastal'."
