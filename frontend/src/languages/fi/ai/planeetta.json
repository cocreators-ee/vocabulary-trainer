  "context": "The word 'planeetta' in Finnish means 'planet'. It refers to a celestial body moving in an orbit around a star. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural, nominative, genitive, partitive, and other cases. For example, 'planeetan' is the genitive form meaning 'of the planet', while 'planeettoja' is the partitive plural meaning 'planets'. The possessive forms also change depending on who owns the planet (e.g., 'planeettani' means 'my planet')."
