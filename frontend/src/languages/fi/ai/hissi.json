  "context": "The word 'hissi' in Finnish means 'elevator' or 'lift', a mechanical device for transporting people or goods vertically. It originates from Swedish and ultimately Middle Low German. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms depending on its grammatical role in a sentence. For example, 'hissin' is the genitive form ('of the elevator'), while 'hissiä' is the partitive form ('some elevator'). It can also be used metaphorically to refer to someone’s mental capabilities."
