  "context": "The Finnish verb 'sanoa' means 'to say' or 'to tell'. It is a very common and versatile word. The form shown here is the infinitive, which is like saying 'to say' in English.  It can also mean to call someone by name. The dictionary definitions show many different conjugations of this verb for different tenses and persons. For example, 'sanot' means 'you say', and 'sanoo' means 'he/she/it says'. You can add suffixes to indicate who is doing the saying (like 'minä sanon' - I say) or when it’s happening (past, present, future). The word also has passive forms like 'sanotaan' which means 'is said'."
