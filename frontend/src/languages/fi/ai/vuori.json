  "context": "The word 'vuori' in Finnish means 'mountain'. It can also refer to a large hill, though typically it implies a significant elevation. The word declines based on case, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as possessive suffixes indicating who owns the mountain (e.g., my mountain, your mountain). There are two main meanings of this word: a physical landform or a large amount of something."
