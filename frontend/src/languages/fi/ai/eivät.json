  "context": "'Eivät' is the 3rd person plural negative verb form in Finnish, equivalent to 'they do not/they don't'. It's used with plural subjects and follows the same conjugation pattern as other negated verbs in Finnish. The word is formed by adding the negative marker 'ei-' to the personal pronoun suffix for 3rd person plural."
