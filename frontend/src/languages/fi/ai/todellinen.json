  "context": "The Finnish word 'todellinen' is an adjective that means 'real', 'true', or 'actual'. It's used to describe something that exists in reality rather than being imaginary, fictional, or hypothetical. The word comes from 'todellisuus' (reality) and has a cognate relationship with this noun form. In Finnish grammar, it follows the typical adjective inflection patterns and would change form based on case, number, and gender when modifying different nouns."
