The word can be used in various contexts such as traffic noise (liikenteen melu), construction noise (rakennusmelu), or general disturbance (yöllinen melu). In Finnish grammar, 'melu' is a common noun that doesn't change form for gender but does have different cases depending on how it's used in a sentence."
