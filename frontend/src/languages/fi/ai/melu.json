  "context": "The word 'melu' in Finnish means noise or racket. It refers to various sounds, usually unwanted and loud. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, and possessive suffixes indicating who owns the noise. For example, 'melumme' means 'our noise'. The related Estonian word 'mõlu' suggests a common origin for this concept."
