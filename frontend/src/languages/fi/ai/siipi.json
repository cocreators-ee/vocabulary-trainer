  "context": "The Finnish word 'siipi' means wing, fin or flipper depending on the context. It typically refers to an appendage used for flying in birds and aircraft (wings), a limb-like structure on aquatic animals like fish (fins), or flipper-like structures in marine mammals. In aviation contexts specifically, it often refers to aircraft wings. The word is always in singular form in these examples."
