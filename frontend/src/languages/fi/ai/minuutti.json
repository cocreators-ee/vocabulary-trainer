  "context": "Minuutti is the basic unit of time, equal to sixty seconds. It's used for measuring short durations and can be found in various contexts like waiting times or sports events. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms depending on its role in a sentence. For example, 'minuutin' is the genitive form meaning 'of the minute', while 'minuuttiin' is the illative form meaning 'to the minute'. It can also be possessive, like 'minuuttini' which means 'my minute'."
