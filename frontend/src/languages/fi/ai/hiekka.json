  "context": "The word 'hiekka' in Finnish means 'sand'. It can also refer to gravel, especially the small fragments used on pavements. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'hiekan' is the genitive form meaning 'of sand', and 'hiekkaa' is the partitive form indicating an indefinite amount of sand.  The plural forms are 'hiekat' (nominative) and 'hiekkoja' (partitive). Possessive suffixes can also be added, like in 'hiekkamme' which means 'our sand'."
