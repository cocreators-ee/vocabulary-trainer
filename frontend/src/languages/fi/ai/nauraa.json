  "context": "The Finnish verb 'nauraa' means 'to laugh'. It is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn’t take a direct object. The dictionary definition shows various conjugations of the verb in different tenses and moods (present, past, conditional, imperative, potential).  It can also be used with allative or partitive cases to indicate laughing *at* something. For example, 'nauraa katketakseen' means 'to laugh one's head off'. The word does not exhibit final gemination in the third-person singular indicative form."
