  "context": "The Finnish verb 'tuntea' is a versatile word meaning to feel, sense, or know. It can refer to physical sensations like feeling pain ('tuntea kipua'), emotional states like feeling happy ('tuntea iloa'), or recognizing someone ('tunnen sinut').  It also means to be familiar with something or someone, implying a deeper knowledge than just knowing *of* it. The word is conjugated and has different forms depending on the tense and person."
