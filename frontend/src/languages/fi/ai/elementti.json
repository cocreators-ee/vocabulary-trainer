  "context": "The Finnish word 'elementti' refers to a prefabricated component or section, often used in construction. It can also mean an abstract element as in a set of elements. The word declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions detail these forms extensively, including possessive variations (e.g., 'elementtini' - my element).  The suffix '-ti' is typical for nouns in Finnish."
