  "context": "The Finnish verb 'seistä' is an intransitive, defective verb that means 'to stand'. It is often used to indicate a state of being stationary or at a halt. The dictionary definitions show it can also have more specific meanings like 'have an erection', but the primary meaning relates to physical standing. Because it is defective, most forms are supplied by the synonymous verb 'seisoa'."
