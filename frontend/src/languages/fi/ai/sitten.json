  "context": "The Finnish word 'sitten' is a versatile adverb that most commonly translates to 'then' in English. It indicates sequence ('first this, then that'), time ('when', 'whenever'), or can be used for emphasis. It also functions as a postposition meaning 'ago'. The word is formed from 'se' (it) + '-ten', and it doesn’t have direct cognates in Swedish or Old English.  It can also function similarly to 'so what?' when used in questions."
