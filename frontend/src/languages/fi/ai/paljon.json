  "context": "The Finnish word 'paljon' is an adverb meaning 'a lot', 'much', or 'plenty'. It can also function as a genitive singular form of the word 'paljo'.  It modifies both countable and uncountable nouns, with uncountable objects taking the partitive singular case and countable objects taking the partitive plural. Interestingly, it can sometimes take a case ending itself, as seen in questions asking 'how much' ('Paljollako vähenee?'). It is also used informally to mean 'late', often in conjunction with 'kello' (clock)."
