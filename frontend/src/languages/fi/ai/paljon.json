  "context": "The Finnish word 'paljon' is an adverb used to indicate a large quantity or amount. It translates to English words like 'a lot of', 'much', or 'many'. In Finnish, it's often placed before the noun it modifies and agrees in number with the noun (singular/plural). When used with singular nouns, it functions similarly to 'much' in English, while with plural nouns, it corresponds to 'many'. It can also modify verbs to indicate doing something frequently or in large quantities."
