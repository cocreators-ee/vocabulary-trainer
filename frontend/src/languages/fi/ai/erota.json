  "context": "The Finnish verb 'erota' means to separate or part from someone, often used in the context of relationships ending. It's an inflected verb that changes form depending on the subject and tense. In present tense it becomes 'eron', past tense 'eroin', and when referring to separation between people it can be reflexive as in 'erota jostakin' (to separate from someone)."
