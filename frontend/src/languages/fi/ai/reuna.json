  "context": "The word 'reuna' in Finnish means edge, brink, rim, border or fringe. It refers to the outer boundary line of something. The word declines based on case; for example, 'reunan' is the genitive form meaning 'of the edge', and 'reunoja' is the partitive plural form meaning 'some edges'. Possessive forms also exist, like 'reunani' which means 'my edge'."
