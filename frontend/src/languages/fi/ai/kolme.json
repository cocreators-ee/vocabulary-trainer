  "context": "The word 'kolme' is the Finnish word for 'three'. It's a cardinal number that indicates quantity. In Finnish, numbers like 'kolme' can be used in different contexts - after certain nouns they may trigger partitive case (like 'kolme koiraa' meaning 'three dogs'). The basic form 'kolme' represents the number three itself, while 'kolmas' would be the ordinal form meaning 'third'."
