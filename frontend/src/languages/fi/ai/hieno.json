  "context": "The Finnish word 'hieno' is an adjective that means fine, nice, beautiful, or excellent. It can be used to describe something as being of good quality or appearance. When describing a masculine singular noun (like talo - house), it appears in its basic form 'hieno'. When modifying the verb (as in the second example with '-sti' adverbial ending), it becomes 'hienosti'. The word can be used for both tangible objects and abstract qualities."
