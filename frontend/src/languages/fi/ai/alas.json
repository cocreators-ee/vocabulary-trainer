  "context": "The Finnish word 'alas' is an adverb that indicates movement or position in a downward direction. It's commonly used to describe motion from a higher point to a lower point, such as going down stairs, falling objects descending, or parachutes jumping down from the sky. This directional adverb corresponds directly to English words like 'down', 'downwards', and 'below' when referring to vertical descent."
