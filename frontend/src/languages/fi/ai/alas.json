  "context": "The word 'alas' is a Finnish adverb meaning 'down', 'downward', or 'below'. It can also be used as an interjection meaning 'down with...' in the context of protests or demonstrations. The word comes from Proto-Finnic *alas and is related to the root 'ala-' which means lower or under.  It inflects based on case, but in these examples it's being used in its basic adverbial form."
