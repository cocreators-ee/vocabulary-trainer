  "context": "In Finnish, 'vain' is an adverb that means 'only', 'just', or 'merely'. It's used to emphasize the exclusiveness or limitation of something. In the first example, it indicates that only one person came to the party. In the second sentence, it emphasizes that someone is just a child (perhaps implying they shouldn't be taken too seriously). The third example shows how 'vain' can modify what is being desired - not wanting money alone but perhaps other things as well."
