  "context": "The Finnish word 'vain' is an adverb that primarily means 'only', 'just', or 'merely'. It can be used to emphasize a limitation or exclusivity.  It also has uses as an emphatic particle in questions and with negative verbs, similar to adding 'right?' or 'didn't you?' to the end of a sentence. Additionally, it can function as permission ('go ahead') when responding to a request."
