  "context": "The Finnish word 'aika' most commonly translates to 'time' in English. It can refer to the general concept of time, a specific period or duration, a moment in time, or even a season.  It also has uses relating to appointments and scheduled events. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, which affects its meaning within a sentence. For example, 'ajan' is the genitive form, often indicating possession ('time of')."
