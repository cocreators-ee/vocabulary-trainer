  "context": "The Finnish word 'syy' has multiple meanings, including reason, cause, fault, fibre and grain. It can refer to the source of an event or action, a motive for something, blame for a mistake, or the linear texture of a material like wood. The word declines based on case; for example, when indicating a reason *for* something, the noun is in the illative case and follows 'syy'. It can also be used with infinitives to indicate a reason *to do* something.  The plural form is 'syyt'."
