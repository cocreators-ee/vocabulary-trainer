  "context": "The word 'puutarha' in Finnish means 'garden'. It refers to a cultivated area of land, often with flowers, vegetables, and trees. The word is derived from 'puu' (tree) + 'tarha' (yard/garden).  It declines based on case; the provided dictionary definitions show various forms for singular and plural nouns, including nominative, genitive, partitive, and others, as well as possessive forms indicating ownership (my garden, your garden, etc.)."
