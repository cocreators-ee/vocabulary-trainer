  "context": "The Finnish word 'työ' translates to 'work' in English. It can refer to work as an activity, a place of work, or one’s job. The word declines depending on the case and number (singular/plural). For example, 'töissä' means 'at work', and is used in plural locative cases when talking about being at work.  The dictionary definitions show that it can also refer to artistic production or even a measure of energy in physics. It’s a very common word with many uses."
