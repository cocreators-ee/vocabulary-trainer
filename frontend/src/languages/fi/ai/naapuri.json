  "context": "The word 'naapuri' means neighbor or neighbour in Finnish. It refers to a person who lives nearby. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and can also be used possessively (e.g., naapurini - my neighbor).  It is of Germanic origin, related to words in Swedish and Low German. The plural form 'naapurit' means neighbors."
