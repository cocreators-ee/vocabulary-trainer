  "context": "The word 'prosessi' in Finnish translates to 'process' in English. It refers to a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular goal. The word can be used in various contexts, such as manufacturing ('tuotantoprosessi' - production process), legal proceedings ('oikeudenkäynti' - trial/court process) and software development.  The noun declines according to the Kotus type 5/risti conjugation without gradation. It has different forms depending on grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) and number (singular or plural). The possessive forms also change based on who owns the process."
