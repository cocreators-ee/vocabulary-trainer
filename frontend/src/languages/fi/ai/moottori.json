  "context": "The Finnish word 'moottori' refers to an engine or motor, typically the power unit in vehicles. It's a loanword from Swedish 'motor'. In Finnish grammar, it follows normal noun declension patterns - for example, 'moottorissa' means 'in the engine', 'moottorille' means 'to the engine', and 'moottoreita' is the partitive plural form meaning 'engines' or some engines. The word can refer to any type of motorized power unit, whether in cars, boats, airplanes, or other machinery."
