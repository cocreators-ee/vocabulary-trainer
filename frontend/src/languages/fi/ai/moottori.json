  "context": "The word 'moottori' in Finnish translates to 'engine' or 'motor' in English. It refers to a machine that converts energy into mechanical motion. The declension information shows how the word changes based on its grammatical role in a sentence, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as various cases like nominative, genitive, partitive, etc. For example, 'moottorin' means 'of the engine', while 'moottoria' means 'some engine'. The possessive forms indicate ownership, such as 'moottorini' meaning 'my engine'."
