  "context": "The Finnish word 'valo' means 'light'. It refers to visible electromagnetic radiation and can also describe a light source like a lamp or signal. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definitions provided. For example, 'valon' is the genitive form meaning 'of light', while 'valoa' is the partitive form often used for expressing an indefinite amount of light."
