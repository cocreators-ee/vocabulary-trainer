  "context": "In Finnish, 'taso' is a noun that can refer to several related concepts: a physical level or flat surface, an abstract level (like skill level), a standard or benchmark for comparison, or balance/equality. It often appears in compound words and has derived forms like the adjective 'tasainen' meaning even/flat/smooth, and the verb 'tasoittaa' meaning to level or equalize."
