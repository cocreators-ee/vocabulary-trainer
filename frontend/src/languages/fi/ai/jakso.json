  "context": "The Finnish word 'jakso' can refer to several related concepts. It commonly means 'episode' when talking about television series or chapters in a story. It also means 'period' as in a timeframe, like a historical period. In other contexts, it can mean 'session' (as in a meeting session) or 'stage' (as in a stage of development). The word is used with different meanings depending on the context - for television content, it's an episode; for time periods, it's a specific timeframe; and for events or processes, it might refer to a particular stage or session."
