  "context": "The word 'ruoho' in Finnish translates to 'grass' in English. It can refer to a single blade of grass or grass collectively, like a lawn. It is a mass noun and has different forms depending on its grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). The dictionary also indicates it can be used as slang for marijuana.  The word declines based on the Kotus type 1/valo system without gradation. You can see possessive forms like 'ruohoni' meaning 'my grass'."
