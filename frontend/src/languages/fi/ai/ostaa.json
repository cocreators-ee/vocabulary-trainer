  "context": "The Finnish verb 'ostaa' means 'to buy'. It is a very common verb and follows regular conjugation patterns. The example sentence 'Mitä pitikään ostaa kaupasta?' shows the colloquial use of the word, asking what one had to buy from the store.  It can also mean 'to believe' or 'accept', but this usage is less frequent. The form 'ostaa' is the present tense third-person singular indicative form, and it does not exhibit final gemination."
