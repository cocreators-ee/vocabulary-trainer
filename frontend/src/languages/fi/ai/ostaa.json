  "context": "The Finnish word 'ostaa' is an infinitive verb meaning 'to buy'. It's the basic form of the verb from which all other conjugations are formed. In different contexts, it can be used for purchasing items, services, or even abstract concepts. The verb follows regular conjugation patterns in present tense: ostin (I bought), ostat (you bought), osti (he/she/it bought), ostimme (we bought), ostitte (you plural bought), ostivat (they bought). In past tense, the perfect form uses the auxiliary verb 'olla' (to be) with the past participle 'ostanut'."
