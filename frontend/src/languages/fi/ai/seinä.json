  "context": "The word 'seinä' in Finnish means 'wall'. It refers to a substantial structure acting as a side or division in a building. The word declines based on case, and the provided dictionary definitions show various forms for singular and plural nouns, including genitive, partitive, illative cases, and possessive forms indicating ownership (my wall, your wall, etc.).  The 'seinä' can also refer to something figurative like an electrical mains when used in a phrase such as 'kytkin sen seinään', meaning 'I plugged it into the mains'."
