  "context": "The Finnish verb 'täyttää' is a versatile word meaning 'to fill', but it also has other uses. It can mean to complete something like a form, or to turn a certain age. The dictionary definition shows that the word comes from Proto-Finnic roots related to 'full'.  It conjugates regularly and can be used in various tenses and moods. In the example 'Hän täytti 25 vuotta', it means 'He/She turned 25'. Note that when referring to age, the verb is technically intransitive but inflects as if it were transitive."
