  "context": "The Finnish word 'nopea' is an adjective meaning 'fast', 'quick', or 'rapid'. It describes something that has great speed. In the comparative form, it becomes 'nopeampi' (faster), and in the superlative form, 'nopein' (fastest). When used as an adverb to describe how quickly something happens, Finnish uses the adverbial form 'nopeasti'. For example, 'nopea auto' means a fast car, while 'juosta nopeasti' means to run quickly."
