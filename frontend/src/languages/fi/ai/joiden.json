  "context": "The word 'joiden' is a Finnish possessive pronoun in the plural form. It functions as the relative pronoun whose in English and connects a main clause to a subordinate clause that describes ownership or association. 'Joiden' is part of the declension pattern for the relative pronoun 'jonka' (whose/singular) where '-den' indicates possession by multiple entities. It's commonly used in written Finnish but less common in spoken language compared to simpler constructions."
