  "context": "The word 'neste' in Finnish translates to 'liquid' or 'fluid' in English. It can refer to any substance that flows freely, like water, oil, or even bodily fluids. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and possessive forms exist to indicate ownership (e.g., 'my liquid', 'your liquid'). You will often see it used in compound words related to specific types of liquids such as 'jarruneste' which means brake fluid."
