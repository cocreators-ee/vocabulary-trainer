It can be used literally for physically lifting objects, like weights at the gym ('Hän nostaa painoja kuntosalilla'), but also figuratively for things like picking up fingerprints ('Poliisi nosti sormenjäljet autosta') or withdrawing money from an ATM ('Voit nostaa rahaa pankkiautomaatista'). The word is transitive, meaning it requires a direct object. It's conjugated in various tenses and moods as shown in the dictionary definition."
