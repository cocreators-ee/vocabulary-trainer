  "context": "The Finnish word 'myös' is an adverb that functions similarly to the English words 'also', 'too', or 'as well'. It's used to add additional information or indicate that something applies in addition to what has already been mentioned. In Finnish sentence structure, it typically appears after the verb but can sometimes be positioned at the beginning of a clause for emphasis."
