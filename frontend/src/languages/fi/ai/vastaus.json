  "context": "The word 'vastaus' is a noun that means 'answer', 'reply', or 'response' in Finnish. It comes from the verb 'vastata' (to answer). The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition; for example, 'vastauksen' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of the answer'.  The plural form is 'vastaukset'. You can also see possessive forms like 'vastaukseni' which means 'my answer'."
