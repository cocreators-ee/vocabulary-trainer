  "context": "The word 'suora' in Finnish can mean straight, direct, or honest. It is an adjective that describes something not crooked or bent, but also a way of communicating truthfully and openly. The form 'suora' is the nominative singular form.  It declines depending on its role in the sentence – for example, 'suoran' is the genitive singular ('of straight'), and 'suorat' is the nominative plural ('straight ones'). It can also be used as a noun meaning line or straight path."
