  "context": "The Finnish verb 'luottaa' is commonly used to express trust or belief in someone or something. It's an active verb that indicates placing confidence or faith in another person, group, or idea. The word can be used with the preposition 'johonkin' (to something) or 'johonkuun' (to someone). When conjugated, it follows regular Finnish verb patterns - for example, 'luotan' means I trust, 'luotat' means you trust, and he/she trusts is 'luottaa'. The negative form would be 'en luota' (I don't trust) or 'ei luota' (he/she doesn't trust)."
