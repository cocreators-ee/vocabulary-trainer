  "context": "The Finnish word 'mutta' is a conjunction used to connect contrasting ideas or clauses. It functions similarly to the English words 'but' and 'however'. In sentences, it often appears between two independent clauses where there's some contrast or opposition between them. The word doesn't change form based on context - it remains 'mutta' regardless of gender, number, or case."
