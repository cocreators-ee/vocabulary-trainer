  "context": "The word 'tapa' in Finnish primarily means 'habit', 'custom', or 'manner'. It can refer to a regular action (like going to the beach on Sundays), a frequently repeated behavior, or someone’s customary way of doing things. The word declines depending on its grammatical role in the sentence; for example, 'tapani' means 'my habit', and 'tapojeni' means 'of my habits'. It can also be used as an imperative verb form meaning 'to happen'."
