  "context": "The word 'päivä' in Finnish primarily means 'day'. It can refer to a calendar day, the period between sunrise and sunset, or even the sun itself. The word declines based on its grammatical case, which affects its meaning within a sentence. For example, the essive case is used when talking about what happened *on* some day(s).  The plural form 'päivät' is used for events lasting more than one day."
