  "context": "In Finnish, 'juuri' is an adverb that indicates exact timing or precise location. It functions similarly to English words like 'just', 'exactly', or 'precisely'. In its basic form, it can indicate something happening at this very moment (similar to 'just now'), being in the exact right place, or referring to something specific without approximation. The word doesn't change form as an adverb and maintains its meaning regardless of context."
