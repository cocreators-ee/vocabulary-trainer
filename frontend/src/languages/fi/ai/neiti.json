  "context": "The Finnish word 'neiti' is a noun that means 'miss' or 'young lady'. It's the formal term for addressing an unmarried woman or girl, similar to how 'Miss' is used in English. The word comes from Swedish 'fröken' and has been part of Finnish vocabulary for centuries. It's commonly used when speaking to service staff, teachers, or any young woman you want to address politely."
