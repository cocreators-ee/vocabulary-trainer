  "context": "The word 'mieli' in Finnish has a broad meaning, encompassing concepts like mind, thought, mood, sense, opinion, and inclination. It can refer to the capability for rational thought, emotional state, or even what one desires. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, which affects its precise meaning within a sentence. For example, 'mielessä' means 'in mind', while 'mielen' is the genitive form often used to express possession or relation ('of the mind')."
