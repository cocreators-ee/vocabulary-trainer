  "context": "The word 'auto' in Finnish means 'car' or 'automobile'. It is a noun of type 1/valo, which doesn’t undergo gradation. The word declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show nominative, genitive, partitive, and other cases for both singular and plural forms. Possessive forms are also included, indicating ownership (my car, your car, etc.). There are many synonyms in Finnish like 'kiesi', 'kosla' or 'pirssi'."
