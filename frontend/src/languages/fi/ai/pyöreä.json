  "context": "The Finnish word 'pyöreä' is an adjective meaning round. It describes shapes that are circular or spherical, without any sharp corners. The word declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show its various forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as different grammatical cases like nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.  The suffix '-ä' indicates it is an adjective. For example, 'pyöreän' means 'of round', while 'pyöreät' means 'round (plural)'."
