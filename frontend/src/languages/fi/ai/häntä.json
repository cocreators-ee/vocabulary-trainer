  "context": "The Finnish word 'häntä' means both 'tail' and 'buttocks'. It's commonly used to refer to the tail of animals (like cats, dogs) but can also mean human buttocks. In animal contexts it's neutral descriptive terminology, while in human contexts it may be considered slightly informal or vulgar depending on context."
