  "context": "The Finnish verb 'löytää' means 'to find'. It is a transitive verb, meaning it takes an object. Importantly, it uses the elative case (or sometimes ablative) to indicate *where* something is found *from*, rather than simply *where* it is. For example, 'Löysin sen autotallista' translates literally as 'I found it from the garage'. The verb conjugates regularly and has various forms for different tenses and moods."
