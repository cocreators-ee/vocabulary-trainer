  "context": "The Finnish word 'tie' means way, road, path or route. It is a common noun and can be used in many contexts related to travel. The word declines based on case; for example, 'tien' is the genitive form (of the road), 'tietä' is the partitive form (of the road) and 'tiehen' is the illative form (to the road). It also has possessive forms depending on who owns or travels the road. For instance, 'tieni' means my road."
