  "context": "The word 'viikko' in Finnish means 'week'. It originates from Proto-Norse and Proto-Germanic roots. The word declines based on case, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as possessive suffixes indicating who owns the week (e.g., my week, your week).  The adessive singular form ('viikolla') is often used to indicate something happening *during* a specific week."
