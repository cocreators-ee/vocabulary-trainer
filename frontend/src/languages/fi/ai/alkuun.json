  "context": "The word 'alkuun' is an adverb meaning 'in the beginning' or 'at first'. It can also be understood as the illative singular of 'alku', which means 'beginning'. The '-un' suffix indicates movement towards a state, in this case, towards the beginning. Therefore it describes starting something."
