  "context": "The word 'kaukainen' is an adjective meaning distant, faraway or remote. It declines based on case and number in Finnish grammar. The root 'kauko-' relates to distance, and '-inen' is a common adjectival suffix.  It can be used to describe physical locations (a far-off village) or abstract concepts like memories. The provided dictionary definitions show the various forms of the word including nominative plural ('kaukaiset') and genitive singular ('kaukaisen'). It also shows possessive forms, indicating who owns something that is distant."
