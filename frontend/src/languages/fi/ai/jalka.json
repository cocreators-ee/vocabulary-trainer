  "context": "The Finnish word 'jalka' can mean both 'foot' and 'leg' in English. In Finnish, it's a common noun that refers to the lower limb of humans or animals. It's an inflected word that changes form depending on its case - for example, 'jalassa' (in the foot/leg), 'jaloissa' (in the feet/legs), 'jalat' (feet/legs). The plural form 'jalat' is used when referring to both feet or legs. In anatomy and everyday conversation, this word covers what English speakers might distinguish between as feet (lower part) and legs (entire limb from thigh down)."
