  "context": "The Finnish word 'lyhyt' is an adjective that means 'short' in English. It's used to describe something with little length or duration. This word can be declined based on the gender and number of the noun it modifies. For example, when modifying a singular nominative feminine noun like 'hius' (hair), it becomes 'lyhyet' in plural form. The word is commonly used to describe physical dimensions, time periods, or concise speech."
