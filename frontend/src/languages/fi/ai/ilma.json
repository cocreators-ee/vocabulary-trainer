  "context": "The Finnish word 'ilma' translates to 'air' or 'weather' in English. It can refer to the atmospheric air, but also to the general state of the weather conditions. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and possessive forms exist to indicate ownership (e.g., my air, your air)."
