  "context": "The Finnish word 'vertaa' is the imperative form of the verb 'vertaista', meaning 'to compare'. It's used when telling someone to make a comparison between two or more things, people, or concepts. In the first sentence, it's used as a command ('Compare this product to another'), in the second as an infinitive after another verb ('He compares prices before making a purchase decision'), and in the third as part of a question asking how one can compare ('How can you compare these two different models?')."
