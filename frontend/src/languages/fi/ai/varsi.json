  "context": "The Finnish word 'varsi' has multiple meanings, including stem (of a plant), handle (of a tool), arm (of a human or object), shaft, and leg. It can refer to both physical parts of plants and animals, as well as components of objects. The word declines based on case, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence. For example, 'varren' is the genitive form meaning 'of the stem/handle/arm', while 'vartta' is the partitive form. It can also be used to indicate location or time along something ('matkan varrella' - along the road)."
