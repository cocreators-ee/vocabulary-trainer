  "context": "The word 'dollari' in Finnish means 'dollar'. It is a unit of currency, typically referring to the US dollar. The word originates from English and follows similar declension patterns as other nouns in Finnish.  It can be singular ('dollari') or plural ('dollarit'). The genitive forms like 'dollarin' and 'dollarien' are used to indicate possession or relationship, for example 'the price of a dollar'. There are also possessive forms indicating who owns the dollar, such as 'dollarini' (my dollar) or 'dollarimme' (our dollar)."
