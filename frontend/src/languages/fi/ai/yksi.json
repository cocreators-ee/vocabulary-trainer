  "context": "The Finnish word 'yksi' means 'one'. It is a cardinal number and can also function as an indefinite article, similar to 'a' or 'an' in English. The declension of the word changes depending on its grammatical case; for example, 'yhden' is the genitive form meaning 'of one', and 'yksiä' is the partitive plural form. It has many derived forms used as adjectives, adverbs, and nouns."
