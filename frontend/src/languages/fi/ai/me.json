  "context": "The Finnish word 'me' is a personal pronoun meaning 'we'. It inflects like a plural noun, even though it doesn't always have an explicit plural marker. The dictionary definition notes that the pronoun can be omitted when the verb already indicates person and number, but it’s often used for emphasis or in colloquial speech.  The word 'meidän' means 'our', as seen in the example sentence 'Näin meidän kesken...', which translates to 'Just between us'. The form 'meille' means 'to our place'."
