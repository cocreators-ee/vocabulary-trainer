  "context": "The word 'punta' in Finnish refers to the act of weighing something, or historically a unit of weight equivalent to a pound. It can also refer to a currency, though this usage is rare and archaic. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural subjects and objects."
