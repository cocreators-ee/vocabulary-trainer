  "context": "The Finnish word 'varhainen' means 'early'. It is an adjective that describes something happening or existing near the beginning of a period of time, like early in the morning. The word declines based on case and number; for example, 'varhaiset' is the plural nominative form meaning 'early ones'. It can also refer to belonging to the early stage of something, such as an 'early Bronze Age'."
