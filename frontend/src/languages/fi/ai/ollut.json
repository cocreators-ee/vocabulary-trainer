  "context": "The Finnish word 'ollut' is the past participle of the verb 'olla', which means 'to be'. It translates to 'been' or 'was' in English. It indicates a state of being that has occurred in the past. The form 'ollut' specifically appears in contexts where it functions as part of a perfect tense construction (e.g., 'olen ollut' - I have been) or as a participle modifying a noun (e.g., 'ollut mies' - the man who was). It declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition."
