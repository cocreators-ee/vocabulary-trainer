  "context": "The word 'höyry' in Finnish refers to steam or vapor, specifically gaseous state of a substance that is normally a solid or liquid. It can also refer to a cloud-like diffused matter suspended in the air. The declension shows different forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as possessive forms indicating who owns the steam (my steam, your steam, etc.). For example 'höyryni' means 'my steam', 'höyrymme' means 'our steam'. It is often used to describe water vapor but can also be applied to other substances. The word is related to similar words in Ingrian and Karelian languages."
