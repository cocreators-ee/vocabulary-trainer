  "context": "The word 'höyry' in Finnish refers to steam or vapor, which is the gaseous form of water that forms when liquid water is heated. It can be used in various contexts such as describing steam rising from boiling water, fog-like conditions, or even metaphorical references to something vague or indistinct. The word is a neuter noun in Finnish and would typically appear in different cases depending on its grammatical function in a sentence."
