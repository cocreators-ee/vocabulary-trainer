  "context": "The word 'hiljainen' is a Finnish adjective that means quiet or silent. It can also describe someone who doesn’t talk much, meaning taciturn. The word declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show all forms of the word. The suffix '-inen' often turns nouns into adjectives, as seen here with 'hilja' (silence) becoming 'hiljainen' (quiet)."
