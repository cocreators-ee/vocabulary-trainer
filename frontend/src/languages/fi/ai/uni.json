  "context": "The word 'uni' in Finnish can mean both 'sleep' (the state of reduced consciousness) and 'dream' (imaginary events seen while sleeping). It is a noun that declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'unen' means 'of sleep', and 'uneen' means 'into sleep'. The word can also be used to describe having trouble sleeping ('saada unta') or experiencing dreams ('nähdä unta')."
