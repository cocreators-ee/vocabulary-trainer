  "context": "The word 'virke' in Finnish refers specifically to a complete sentence, ending with punctuation like a period, exclamation mark or question mark. It does not refer to parts of sentences (clauses) but the whole thing. The word can be inflected for number; 'virkkeet' is the plural form meaning 'sentences'. It also has possessive forms indicating who owns the sentence, such as 'virkkeeni' which means 'my sentence'."
