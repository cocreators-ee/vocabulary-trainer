  "context": "The Finnish verb 'tapahtua' means to happen or occur. It's an impersonal verb that doesn't have a subject, as events naturally don't perform the action of happening on their own - they just happen. The word is often used when describing events, incidents, or occurrences without specifying who caused them."
