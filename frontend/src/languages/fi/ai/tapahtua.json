  "context": "The Finnish verb 'tapahtua' means 'to happen', 'to take place', or 'to occur'. It is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn’t take a direct object. The word originates from Proto-Finnic *tapahtudak and is related to the root 'tapa-' which means 'to meet'.  The provided examples demonstrate its use in various contexts, including general possibilities ('Anything can happen...'), conditional statements ('If it can happen...'), and questions about current events ('What's going on here?'). The verb conjugates extensively as shown in the dictionary definition."
