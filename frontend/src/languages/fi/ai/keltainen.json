  "context": "The Finnish word 'keltainen' is an adjective that means 'yellow' in English. It describes something that has the color yellow, like objects, flowers, or animals. In Finnish adjectives change form based on case and number - for example, the singular nominative form is 'keltainen', but it would become 'keltaisen' in partitive case or 'keltaiset' in plural nominative."
