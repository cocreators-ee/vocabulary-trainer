  "context": "The Finnish verb 'itkeä' means 'to cry' or 'to weep'. It is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn't take a direct object. The dictionary definition shows various conjugations of the verb in different tenses and moods, including present, past, conditional, imperative, and potential.  The word can also be used transitively to mean 'to cry about something', though this usage is less common. For example, 'itkeä menneisyyttä' would mean 'to cry over the past'. The -ä ending indicates the infinitive form of the verb."
