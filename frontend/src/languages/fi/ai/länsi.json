  "context": "The word 'länsi' in Finnish means 'west'. It can refer to the direction, or to 'the West' as a region or country. The declension shows that it is a noun with different forms depending on its grammatical role in the sentence. For example, 'lännen' is the genitive form meaning 'of the west', and 'länteen' is the illative form meaning 'to the west'. You can also see possessive forms like 'länteni' which means 'my west'."
