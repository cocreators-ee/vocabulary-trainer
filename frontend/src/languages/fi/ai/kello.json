  "context": "The Finnish word 'kello' can mean clock, time, or bell. It originates from Proto-Finnic *këllo and shares roots with German and Swedish words for 'bell'. The word is not inflected when used before a numeral (e.g., kello kahdeksan - eight o'clock).  It has various forms depending on grammatical case, as shown in the declension table provided. It can also refer to egg timers ('muna kello') or be used metaphorically for regularity."
