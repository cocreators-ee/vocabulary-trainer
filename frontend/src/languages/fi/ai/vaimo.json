  "context": "The word 'vaimo' in Finnish means 'wife'. It originates from Proto-Finnic *vaimo, which originally meant 'spirit, soul'. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'vaimon' is the genitive form meaning 'of a wife', and 'vaimolle' is the dative form meaning 'to a wife'. It can also refer to a woman generally, especially an elderly one, though this usage is archaic. The possessive forms indicate who the wife belongs to; for example, 'vaimoni' means 'my wife'."
