  "context": "The Finnish word 'nopeasti' is an adverb that means 'quickly', 'rapidly', or 'fast'. It describes the manner in which an action is performed - at high speed or with great efficiency. This word comes from the root adjective 'nopea' (meaning 'fast' or 'quick') and the adverbial suffix '-sti', which is commonly used to form adverbs from adjectives in Finnish. When describing how someone should perform an action, 'nopeasti' can also imply urgency."
