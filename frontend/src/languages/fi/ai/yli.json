  "context": "The Finnish word 'yli' is a versatile postposition and preposition with multiple meanings related to being over, above, or past something. It can indicate spatial relationships (like flying *over* an object), temporal relationships (*after* a certain time), or quantity (*more than* a number).  It often takes the genitive case as its complement, but sometimes partitive is also possible depending on context and personal preference. The word 'yli' cannot take possessive suffixes; for those cases, 'ylitse' is used instead."
