  "context": "The word 'mahdollinen' is an adjective meaning possible, potential or feasible. It comes from the root 'mahto', which relates to ability and possibility. The ending '-llinen' is a common adjectival suffix in Finnish.  It declines based on case and number; for example, 'mahdolliset' is the plural nominative form, while 'mahdollista' is the partitive singular. Possessive forms also exist, like 'mahdollisemme' meaning 'our possible'. It can be used to describe something that *could* happen or a viable option."
