  "context": "The word 'tiesi' is a Finnish word with multiple meanings depending on the context. It can be a noun, which is the second-person singular possessive form of 'tie' (way), or it can be a verb, specifically the third-person singular past indicative of 'tietää' (to know). The examples show both usages: as a verb meaning 'knew', and as part of an imperative sentence. It's important to consider the surrounding words to determine which meaning is intended."
