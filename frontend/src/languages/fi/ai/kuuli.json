  "context": "The Finnish word 'kuuli' is the past tense third-person singular form of the verb 'kuulla', which means 'to hear' or 'to listen'. In English, this would be translated as 'he/she/it heard'. The verb indicates that someone perceived sounds with their ears in the past. It can refer to both the act of hearing (passively receiving sound) and listening (paying attention to what is heard)."
