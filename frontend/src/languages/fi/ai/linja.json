  "context": "The word 'linja' in Finnish can refer to a physical line, like a path or boundary. It also commonly means a route of transportation, such as a bus or tram line. Additionally, it can signify a policy or principle. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'linjan' is the genitive form meaning 'of the line', and 'linjalla' indicates being 'on the line'. It also has plural forms like 'linjat'."
