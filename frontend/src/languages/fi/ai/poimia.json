  "context": "The Finnish verb 'poimia' means to pick or gather something, often by hand. It can refer to physical objects like berries or trash, but also abstract things like information from a text. The word is conjugated and changes form depending on the tense and person (I pick, you pick, he/she picks etc.). For example, 'poimin' means 'I pick', while 'poimii' means 'he/she picks'. It can also be used in passive forms like 'poimitaan' which means 'is being picked'."
