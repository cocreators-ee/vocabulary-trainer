  "context": "The Finnish word 'mitä' is a versatile word with multiple uses. It functions as a partitive pronoun, meaning it indicates an indefinite or incomplete object.  It’s often translated as 'what', but can also be used to establish comparisons ('the... the') and for emphasis. The dictionary definitions show its use in questions like 'What are you doing?' and exclamations expressing surprise or frustration. It's important to note that it appears in various phrases with different levels of vulgarity, from mild expressions like 'what on Earth?' to very strong ones."
