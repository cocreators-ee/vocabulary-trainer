  "context": "The Finnish word 'mitä' is the partitive form of 'mikä', meaning 'what' or 'which'. It's commonly used in questions to inquire about objects, concepts, or information. In Finnish grammar, the partitive case often indicates an incomplete action or ongoing process, but in questions like this, it functions as the standard interrogative pronoun for asking about things."
