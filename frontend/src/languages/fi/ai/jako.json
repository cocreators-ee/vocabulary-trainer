  "context": "The Finnish word 'jako' is a noun that primarily refers to the concept of division, distribution, or sharing. It can be used in mathematical contexts to mean ratio or fraction, but more commonly it appears in everyday language when talking about dividing something among people, distributing resources, or splitting responsibilities. The word comes from the verb 'jakaa' (to divide/share), and 'jako' represents the noun form of this action."
