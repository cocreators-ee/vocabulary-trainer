  "context": "The Finnish word 'jälleen' is an adverb that means 'again' or 'once more'. It indicates repetition of an action, occurrence, or state. The word can appear at various positions in a sentence but typically follows the verb it modifies. In its basic form, it's used to express that something happens for a second time or repeatedly."
