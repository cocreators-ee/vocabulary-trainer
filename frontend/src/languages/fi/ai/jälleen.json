  "context": "The word 'jälleen' is a Finnish adverb meaning 'again' or 'once again'. It can also be used as a prefix to indicate repetition, similar to 're-' in English. The dictionary definitions show that it originates from the allative case of the word 'jälki', which means 'trace' or 'footprint', and has cognates in other Finnic languages like Ingrian and Karelian. It is often used in compounds to form new words related to repeating an action."
