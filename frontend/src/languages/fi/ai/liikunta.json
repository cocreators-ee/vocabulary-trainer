  "context": "The Finnish word 'liikunta' refers to exercise or physical activity. It can also mean physical education as a subject in school. The word declines based on case, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence – nominative for the subject, genitive showing possession, partitive expressing an incomplete amount, and so on. For example, 'liikuntani' means 'my exercise', while 'liikuntaa' is used when talking about doing some exercise."
