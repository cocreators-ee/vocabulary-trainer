  "context": "The word 'nainen' in Finnish means 'woman'. It is a common noun and can refer to any adult female human. The declension patterns are complex, as shown in the dictionary definitions, with different forms depending on grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) and number (singular or plural).  The possessive forms also change based on who possesses the woman. It's important to note that 'naiset' is the plural form meaning 'women'."
