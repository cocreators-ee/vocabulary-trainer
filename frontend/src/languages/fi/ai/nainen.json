  "context": "The Finnish word 'nainen' is a noun that refers to an adult human female. It's the basic term for woman in Finnish, and it can be used in various contexts similar to how we use 'woman', 'female', or 'lady' in English. The word follows standard Finnish grammatical patterns for nouns, including having different cases depending on its function in a sentence (as seen in the examples where it appears in nominative case)."
