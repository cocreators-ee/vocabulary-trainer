  "context": "The Finnish word 'usein' is an adverb that means 'often' or 'frequently'. It indicates the frequency of an action occurring. In Finnish, adverbs typically appear in a fixed form and don't change based on gender or number, though they can be modified with intensifiers or other modifiers. The word doesn't decline for case like nouns do."
