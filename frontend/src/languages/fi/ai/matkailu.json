  "context": "The Finnish word 'matkailu' refers to the activity of traveling and tourism. It is a noun that can be declined into different forms depending on its role in a sentence, as shown in the dictionary definitions. The suffix '-u' indicates it’s a noun, and the provided declension table shows how it changes based on grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) and number (singular or plural).
