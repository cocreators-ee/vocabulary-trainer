  "context": "The Finnish word 'turvallinen' is an adjective that means 'safe' or 'secure'. It describes a state of being free from danger, harm, or risk. The word can be modified to different forms such as 'turvallisuus' (noun form meaning safety) and 'turvallisesti' (adverbial form meaning safely). When used to describe places, it indicates that something is secure and protected; when describing actions or behaviors, it means they are conducted without risk."
