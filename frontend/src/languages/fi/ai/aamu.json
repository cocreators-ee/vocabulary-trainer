  "context": "The Finnish word 'aamu' means 'morning'. It refers to the early part of the day, typically from dawn until noon. In Finnish grammar, it's a common noun that doesn't have grammatical gender. It can appear in different cases - for example, 'aamulla' (in/on the morning) and 'aamulla' (at morning time). The word is used daily when greeting people with 'Hyvää aamua!' which means 'Good morning!'."
