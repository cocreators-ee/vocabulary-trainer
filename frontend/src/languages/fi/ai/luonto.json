  "context": "The word 'luonto' in Finnish refers to nature or the environment. It can also describe the inherent character of a person, though this usage is becoming less common and 'luonne' is preferred for that meaning. The word has been attested since the 16th century and originates from the verb 'luoda', which means 'to create'.  The noun declines in various cases (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) as shown in the dictionary definition."
