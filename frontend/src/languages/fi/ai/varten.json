  "context": "The Finnish word 'varten' is a postposition that indicates purpose or beneficiary. It’s often translated as 'for' in English, and it follows the partitive case. The wiktionary definition suggests it may be derived from older forms related to 'varsi' (stem) but its current usage focuses on expressing what something is intended for or who benefits from something.  It can also be used to ask 'why', as in 'mitä varten?' (what for?)."
