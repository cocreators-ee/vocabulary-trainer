  "context": "The Finnish word 'kylä' means village or hamlet in English. It is a common noun referring to a small community of houses and buildings, typically smaller than a town but larger than just a few isolated houses. In Finland, kylä is an important social and geographical unit that often has its own identity, traditions, and sometimes even services like a school or chapel."
