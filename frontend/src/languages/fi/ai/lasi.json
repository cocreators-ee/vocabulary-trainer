  "context": "The Finnish word 'lasi' primarily means 'glass', both the substance and a drinking vessel. It can also refer to eyeglasses, but in this context it is most likely referring to a physical glass used for holding liquids. The word has cognates in other Germanic languages like English ('glass') and Middle Low German ('glas').  The plural form is 'lasit'."
