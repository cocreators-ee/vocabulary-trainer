  "context": "The Finnish word 'pala' is a noun that means 'piece', 'portion', or 'slice'. It refers to a small part broken off from something larger, such as a piece of food (cake, bread), a fragment of glass, or any other material divided into smaller parts. The word can be used in both singular and plural forms ('pala' vs. 'palat'), and it's commonly used when referring to portions of items that are naturally divisible."
