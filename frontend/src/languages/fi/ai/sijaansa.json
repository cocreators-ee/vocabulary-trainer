  "context": "The word 'sijaansa' is an inessive form (inessive case) of the Finnish word 'sija', meaning 'place'. The '-nsa' suffix indicates possession, so this literally means 'in its place' or 'in its stead'. It's used to indicate that something is located where something else was expected to be, or that one thing has taken the position of another."
