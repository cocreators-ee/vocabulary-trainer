  "context": "The word 'tuhatta' is the partitive case form of the Finnish numeral 'tuhat' (thousand). It indicates an unspecified or partial amount of something, equivalent to saying 'thousand of' or 'a thousand units of' in English. This form is commonly used when referring to quantities that are not exact whole numbers or when talking about a portion of a larger group."
