  "context": "The word 'tuhatta' is the partitive singular form of 'tuhat', which means 'thousand'. It's often used when referring to amounts greater than one thousand, especially in compounds. For example, 'kymmenen tuhatta' means 'ten thousand'. Because it is a partitive form, it indicates an indefinite quantity or part of something – you wouldn’t say ‘tuhatta euroa’ if you meant exactly 1000 euros, but rather some amount over that."
