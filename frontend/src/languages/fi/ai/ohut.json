  "context": "The word 'ohut' in Finnish means 'thin'. It is an adjective that describes something having a small thickness. The word declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'ohuet hiukset' means 'thin hair', where 'ohuet' is the plural form of the adjective.  The suffix '-i' often indicates the plural form."
