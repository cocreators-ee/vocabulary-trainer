  "context": "The Finnish word 'jotka' is a relative pronoun that means 'who' or 'which' in English. It's used to connect clauses and provide additional information about people or things. Specifically, 'jotka' is the plural form of the relative pronoun 'jonka', which corresponds to English 'that/which'. In Finnish grammar, relative pronouns agree in number with the noun they refer to - so 'jotka' is used when referring to multiple people or things (plural), while 'jonka' would be used for singular references."
