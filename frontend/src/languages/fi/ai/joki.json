  "context": "The word 'joki' in Finnish means 'river'. It refers to a large natural stream of water flowing in a channel to the sea, a lake, or another such stream. The word is of Proto-Uralic origin and has cognates in other Finno-Ugric languages like Estonian 'jõgi'.  The noun declines according to type 7*D/ovi with k-∅ gradation, meaning its form changes depending on its grammatical role in a sentence. For example, the genitive singular is 'joen' (of the river) and the partitive singular is 'jokea' (of river)."
