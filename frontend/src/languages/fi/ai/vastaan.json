  "context": "The word 'vastaan' is a versatile Finnish word with multiple meanings and grammatical functions. It can be an illative singular of 'vasta-', functioning as a postposition meaning 'towards' or 'against'. It also serves as an adverb indicating 'back', often in the context of returning actions like smiling back or fighting back, and as a preposition meaning 'versus' or 'against'. The word is related to the verb 'vastata' (to answer) and the noun 'vasta' (answer). Possessive forms exist when used with personal pronouns, indicating direction ('towards me', 'towards you')."
