  "context": "The word 'maili' in Finnish means 'mile'. It is borrowed from English and functions as a noun. The declension table shows how the word changes based on its grammatical case, number (singular or plural), and possessor. For example, 'mailin' is the genitive singular form ('of a mile'), while 'maileja' is the partitive plural form ('some miles'). It can also be used in compound words like 'merimaili' which means 'nautical mile'."
