  "context": "The word 'paksu' in Finnish generally means thick, but can also refer to fat or dense depending on the context. It is an adjective that declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. The word can also colloquially mean pregnant or brazen.  The suffix '-i' indicates possession, for example 'paksuni' means 'my thick one'. There are many compound words using 'paksu', such as 'paksukuorinen' meaning 'thick-skinned'."
