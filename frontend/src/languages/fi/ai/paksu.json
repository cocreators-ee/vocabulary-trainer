  "context": "The Finnish word 'paksu' is an adjective that means thick, heavy in terms of substance, or bulky. It's used to describe things with considerable thickness or density, whether it's clothing like jackets, physical features like hair, or natural elements like clouds. The word changes form depending on the case and number of the noun it modifies - for example, 'paksu' is the nominative singular form, while 'paksut' would be the nominative plural form."
