  "context": "The Finnish word 'rengas' most commonly means 'tire' or 'tyre', referring to the rubber covering around a wheel. However, it can also mean 'ring' in a more general sense, like a loop or hoop. The word originates from Proto-Finnic and has connections to Proto-Germanic roots meaning 'ring'. It declines based on grammatical case, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, as well as possessive suffixes indicating who owns the ring/tire. For example, 'renkaani' means 'my tire'."
