  "context": "The word 'raskas' is a Finnish adjective that primarily means 'heavy' in terms of physical weight. However, it also has broader meanings relating to difficulty, intensity, or emotional burden. It can describe something physically hard to carry, a challenging task, or a somber mood. The word declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms used depending on its grammatical role in a sentence. For example, 'raskaan' is the genitive singular form, while 'raskaat' is the nominative plural."
