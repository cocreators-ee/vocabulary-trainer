  "context": "The Finnish word 'kaikki' is a very versatile pronoun that can mean 'everything', 'everyone', or 'all', depending on the context. It declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and can also be used to form compound words. The plural nominative form is singular ('kaikki'), but verbs will take plural forms when referring to everyone."
