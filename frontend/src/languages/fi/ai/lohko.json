  "context": "The word 'lohko' in Finnish refers to a piece cut off something, like a slice or wedge. It can also mean a section, lobe (in anatomy), or block/chunk (in computing). In sports contexts it means group, as in a subset of teams playing against each other. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example 'lohkon' is the genitive form meaning 'of the piece', and 'lohkoon' is the illative form meaning 'into the piece'. It can also be used as a verb, but that usage is less common."
