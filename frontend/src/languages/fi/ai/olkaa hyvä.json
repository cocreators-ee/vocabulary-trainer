  "context": "The phrase 'olkaa hyvä' is a polite Finnish expression used in several contexts. It’s most commonly translated as ‘you’re welcome’, but can also mean ‘please’ or ‘here you are’. The form 'olkaa' indicates that it is addressed to multiple people, though using it for one person is becoming increasingly common. It comes from the imperative of the verb 'olla' (to be) and 'hyvä' (good)."
