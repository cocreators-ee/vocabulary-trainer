  "context": "'Olkaa hyvä' is a polite Finnish phrase used to make requests or ask for something in a courteous manner. It literally translates to 'be good,' but functions similarly to the English 'please.' The phrase consists of 'olkaa' (imperative plural form of 'olla' - to be) and 'hyvä' (good). It's commonly used in service situations, when asking someone to do something, or as a polite way to get attention."
