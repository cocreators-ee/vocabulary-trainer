  "context": "The Finnish word 'symboli' translates to 'symbol' in English. It can also mean 'sign' or 'emblem'. The word is of Latin origin and refers to something that represents something else, like a letter representing a sound.  It declines based on case; the provided dictionary definitions show nominative, genitive, partitive, and other cases for both singular and plural forms. Possessive suffixes are also shown, indicating ownership (e.g., 'symbolini' means 'my symbol')."
