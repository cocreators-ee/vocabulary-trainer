  "context": "Maito is the Finnish word for milk. It refers to the white liquid produced by mammals, and can also refer to an individual serving of milk or non-dairy alternatives like plant-based milks. The word declines based on grammatical case; 'maidot' is the plural form, indicating multiple servings or sources of milk. Possessive forms exist to show ownership (e.g., 'maitoni' - my milk)."
