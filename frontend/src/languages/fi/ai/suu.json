  "context": "The Finnish word 'suu' means 'mouth' in English. It refers to the oral cavity, or opening in the face through which food is consumed and speech is produced. In Finnish grammar, it's a common noun that doesn't change form for plural - it remains 'suu'. When combined with other words, it can form compounds like 'suukko' (kiss) or be used in expressions like 'suun kautta' (orally)."
