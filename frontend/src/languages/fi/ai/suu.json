  "context": "The word 'suu' in Finnish means 'mouth'. It can refer to the physical opening of the mouth, or the end of a river where it flows into a larger body of water. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definitions provided. For example, 'suun' is the genitive form meaning 'of the mouth', and 'suuhun' is the illative form meaning 'into the mouth'. It can also be used figuratively to mean beginning or onset."
