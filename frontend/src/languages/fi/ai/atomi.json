  "context": "The word 'atomi' in Finnish means 'atom'. It originates from Latin and Ancient Greek. Interestingly, it was also used to name a type of meat pie in Lappeenranta! The word declines based on case; for example, the nominative plural is 'atomit', and the genitive singular is 'atomin'. There are also possessive forms depending on who possesses the atom, such as 'atomini' (my atom) or 'atomisi' (your atom)."
