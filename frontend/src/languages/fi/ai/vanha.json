  "context": "The Finnish word 'vanha' is an adjective that means 'old'. It can refer to the age of people, animals, or things. The word declines based on case and number; for example, 'vanhat' is the plural nominative form meaning 'the old ones', while 'vanhan' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of the old one'. It has comparative forms like 'vanhempi' (older) and superlative 'vanhin' (oldest)."
