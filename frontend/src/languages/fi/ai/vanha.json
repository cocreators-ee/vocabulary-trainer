  "context": "The Finnish word 'vanha' is an adjective that means 'old' in English. It can be used to describe objects, buildings, people, or concepts that have existed for a long time. When referring to people, it typically indicates someone who is elderly or aged. The word changes form depending on the case and number - 'vanha' is the basic singular nominative form. In plural, it becomes 'vanhat'."
