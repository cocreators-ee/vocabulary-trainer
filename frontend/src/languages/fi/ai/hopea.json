  "context": "The word 'hopea' in Finnish means 'silver'. It can refer to the metallic element, objects made of silver (like jewelry or tableware), or a silver medal awarded as a second prize. The word declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'hopeat' is the plural form meaning 'silvers', and possessive forms exist to indicate ownership."
