  "context": "The word 'pelko' in Finnish means fear or dread. It is a noun that declines based on case and possession, as shown in the dictionary definition. The base form 'pelko' refers to general fear, while different inflections indicate whose fear it is (e.g., 'pelkoni' - my fear) or where the fear exists (e.g., 'pelossa' - in fear). It can also be used in plural forms like 'pelot'. The suffix '-o' often marks nouns."
