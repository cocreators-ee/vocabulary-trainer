  "context": "The Finnish word 'orja' means 'slave' in English. It refers to a person who is owned by another person and forced to work without freedom or pay. The word can be used for both male and female slaves, though the plural form 'orjat' would refer to multiple slaves of any gender. In historical contexts, it describes people held against their will under systems of slavery."
