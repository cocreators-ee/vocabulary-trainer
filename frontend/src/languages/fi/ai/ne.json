  "context": "The Finnish word 'ne' is a demonstrative pronoun that refers to things or animals. It is the plural form of 'se', meaning 'it' or 'that'.  It can be translated as 'they' or 'those'. The wiktionary definition indicates it’s used for objects not specifically pointed out by the speaker, and colloquially for people. The declension table shows how it changes based on grammatical case (nominative, genitive, etc.)."
