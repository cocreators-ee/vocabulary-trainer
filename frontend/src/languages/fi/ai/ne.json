  "context": "In Finnish, 'ne' is a demonstrative pronoun meaning 'those' when used to refer to things that are not near the speaker, and it's also the third-person plural pronoun meaning 'they'. It can be used for both inanimate objects and people. The word doesn't change form based on gender but does have different cases (like 'niin', 'näiden', etc.)."
