  "context": "The word 'punainen' is a Finnish adjective meaning 'red'. It declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. The combining form is 'puna-', while 'puna' can also be used as a noun.  It can refer to the color itself or objects that are red. In plural forms like 'punaiset', it refers to multiple red things, such as 'red lights'. It can also have political connotations referring to 'the Reds' in historical context."
