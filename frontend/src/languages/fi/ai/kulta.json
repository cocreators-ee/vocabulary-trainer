  "context": "The word 'kulta' in Finnish has multiple meanings. It most commonly refers to the metal gold, but it is also used as a term of endearment meaning darling or dear. The word declines based on possession and case, as shown in the dictionary definitions. For example, 'kultani' means 'my darling'."
