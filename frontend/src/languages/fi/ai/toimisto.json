  "context": "The word 'toimisto' in Finnish translates to 'office' in English. It refers to a building or room used for professional work. The word is derived from the root 'toimi', meaning chore, task, activity, and has various inflections depending on its grammatical role in a sentence, including singular and plural forms as well as different cases like nominative, genitive, partitive, etc. Possessive forms also exist to indicate ownership (e.g., my office, your office)."
