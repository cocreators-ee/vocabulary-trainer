  "context": "The word 'uusi' is a common Finnish adjective meaning 'new'. It can refer to something that has recently been created, obtained, or come into existence. In Finnish grammar, adjectives like 'uusi' must agree in number with the noun they modify - so it would become 'uudet' (plural form) when modifying plural nouns. The word is commonly used in everyday Finnish for describing new possessions, recent developments, or fresh beginnings."
