  "context": "The word 'uusi' in Finnish means 'new'. It is an adjective that declines based on case and number. As shown in the declension table, it changes form depending on its role in a sentence. The example sentences demonstrate its use with different nouns ('auto' - car, 'puhelin' - phone, 'kirja' - book).  The suffix '-i' is often used to indicate the nominative singular form."
