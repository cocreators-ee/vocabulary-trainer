  "context": "The Finnish verb 'antaa' is a versatile word meaning primarily 'to give', but also encompassing meanings like 'to allow', 'to present', or 'to donate'. It’s a highly common verb, and its conjugation follows the Kotus type 56*J/kaivaa pattern with nt-gradation. The indirect object (the recipient of something given) is expressed in the allative case.  The word can also mean to issue an order or decree, as in 'Valtioneuvosto antoi asetuksen' (The Cabinet issued a decree)."
