  "context": "The Finnish word 'jalat' is the plural form of 'jalka', meaning both 'feet' and 'legs'. In English, we often distinguish between feet (the lower extremities below the ankle) and legs (from thigh to foot), but in Finnish, both concepts are typically covered by this word depending on context. The word follows normal Finnish declension patterns with the plural marker '-t' added to the stem."
