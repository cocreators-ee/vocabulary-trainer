  "context": "The word 'veli' in Finnish means 'brother'. It can also refer to a male sibling in general. In Helsinki slang, it is sometimes used as 'bro', often associated with immigrants. The noun declines irregularly, with the stem being 'velj(e)-'. There are different forms depending on the case and possessor (my brother, your brother, etc.)."
