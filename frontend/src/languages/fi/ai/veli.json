  "context": "In Finnish, 'veli' means brother or male sibling. It's a common noun used to refer to one's brother. The word can be modified with possessive suffixes to indicate whose brother it is - for example, 'minun veli' (my brother), 'sinun veli' (your brother), 'hänen veljensä' (his/her/their brother). Finnish also has different cases, so you might see forms like 'veljeä' in partitive case or 'veljen' in genitive case depending on how it's used in a sentence."
