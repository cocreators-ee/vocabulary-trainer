  "context": "The word 'leiri' in Finnish means 'camp' or 'encampment'. It refers to a place where people stay temporarily, often outdoors. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.).  It can also be used to refer to different types of camps like summer camps ('kesäleiri') or military camps ('sotilasleiri')."
