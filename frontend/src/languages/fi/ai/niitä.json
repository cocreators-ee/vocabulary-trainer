  "context": "The word 'niitä' is the partitive plural form of the pronoun 'ne', which means 'they' or 'those'. It is used to refer to multiple objects that are not specifically identified. It can also be a verb inflection of 'niittää' (to reap), but in this case it seems more likely to be the pronoun, as it appears in common sentence structures for pronouns. The partitive plural form indicates an unspecified quantity or incomplete set of the objects being referred to."
