  "context": "The Finnish word 'tämä' is a demonstrative pronoun meaning 'this'. It can also refer to 'that', depending on the context.  It declines through various cases, as shown in the dictionary definition, and has different forms for singular and plural (nämä). The word indicates proximity; things considered nearby or proximal are referred to with 'tämä' while more distant things use other demonstratives like 'tuo'. It can also be used as a determiner meaning 'this'."
