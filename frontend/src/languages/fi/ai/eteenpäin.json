  "context": "The Finnish word 'eteenpäin' is an adverb that means forward, onward, or ahead. It indicates movement in a forward direction from the current position. The word can be broken down as 'etee-' (toward/forward) + '-n-' (possessive suffix for third person singular/his/her) + '-päin' (directional suffix). This directional adverb is commonly used to describe physical movement forward, but it can also metaphorically refer to progress or advancement in time, projects, or situations. It's the opposite of 'taaksepäin' (backward)."
