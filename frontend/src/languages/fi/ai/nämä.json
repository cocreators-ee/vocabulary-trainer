  "context": "The Finnish word 'nämä' is a demonstrative pronoun that means 'these'. It's used to point out specific items or people near the speaker. Like other Finnish words, it changes form based on context - for example, 'tämä' means singular 'this', while 'nämä' indicates plural 'these'. The word follows the vowel harmony rules of Finnish and is commonly used in everyday speech when referring to multiple objects that are close to the speaker."
