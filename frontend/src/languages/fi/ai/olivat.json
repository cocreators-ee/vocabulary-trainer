  "context": "The Finnish word 'olivat' is the third person plural past tense form of the verbolla (to be). It corresponds to English 'they were' or 'they had been'. This form indicates that multiple people/things existed, were located somewhere, or were in a particular state in the past. The '-vat' ending is characteristic of the third person plural present/past indicative conjugation in Finnish."
