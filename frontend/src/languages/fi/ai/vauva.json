  "context": "The word 'vauva' in Finnish means 'baby'. It is an informal term for a very young child, and can also refer to baby animals. The word declines based on case; the provided dictionary definitions show how it changes depending on its grammatical role in a sentence. For example, 'vauvan' indicates the genitive case ('of the baby'), while 'vauvaa' is the partitive case. It also shows possessive forms like 'vauvani' (my baby) and plural forms such as 'vauvat' (babies)."
