  "context": "The Finnish word 'sointu' refers to a chord in music, or the harmonious sound produced by combining musical notes. It can also refer more generally to harmony or resonance. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, and possessive suffixes indicating who owns the chord (my chord, your chord, etc.)."
