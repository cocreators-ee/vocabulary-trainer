  "context": "Tosiasia is a Finnish noun meaning 'fact' or 'reality'. It's formed from the words 'tosinen' (second) and 'asia' (matter/thing), literally meaning 'the second matter', referring to established facts that exist independently of opinions. The word often appears in contexts where distinguishing between fact and opinion is important."
