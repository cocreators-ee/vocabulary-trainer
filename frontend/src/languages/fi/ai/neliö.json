  "context": "The word 'neliö' in Finnish means 'square'. It can refer to a geometric shape with four equal sides and right angles, or it can be used as a unit of area (similar to square meters). The declension shows that the word changes form depending on its role in the sentence – nominative for the subject ('neliö'), genitive showing possession ('neliön'), partitive indicating an incomplete quantity ('neliötä'), and so on. It also has different forms for singular ('neliö') and plural ('neliöt'). The possessive forms show who owns the square, with variations based on person (my, your, his/her/its) and number (singular or plural)."
