  "context": "The Finnish word 'voima' translates to strength, power, or force in English. It is a noun that can refer to physical strength, the ability to influence events, or a physical quantity like in physics. The word declines based on case and number; for example, 'voiman' means 'of strength', 'voimaa' is the partitive form often used when referring to an indefinite amount of strength, and 'voimat' is the plural form meaning 'strengths'. Possessive forms also exist, like 'voimani' which means 'my strength'."
