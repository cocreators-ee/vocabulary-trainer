  "context": "The word 'lämmin' is an adjective meaning warm or heated in Finnish. It can also imply a feeling of coziness. The declension shows that it changes form depending on its role in the sentence, and possessive forms exist to indicate ownership (e.g., my warm, your warm).  The suffix '-in' often indicates a state or quality, as seen in 'lämmin' itself describing the state of being warm."
