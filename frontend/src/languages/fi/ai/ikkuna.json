  "context": "The Finnish word 'ikkuna' means 'window'. It refers to an opening in a wall or roof for light and air. The word has cognates in other Finno-Ugric languages, potentially influenced by the Russian word for 'icon'.  It can also refer to a period of opportunity (figuratively) or an area on a computer screen (in modern usage). The plural form is 'ikkunat'."
