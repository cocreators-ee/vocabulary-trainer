  "context": "The Finnish word 'ääni' has multiple meanings, including sound as a physical phenomenon, the voice of a person, audio signals, and a single vote in an election. It declines based on grammatical case, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, and possessive suffixes indicating who owns the 'voice' or 'sound'. The word can also refer to the ability to speak."
