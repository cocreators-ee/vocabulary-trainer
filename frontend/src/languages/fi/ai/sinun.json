  "context": "The word 'sinun' is the genitive singular form of 'sinä', which means 'you'. It functions as a possessive pronoun, indicating ownership or association. The -si suffix denotes possession specifically related to 'you'. It can also be used in some dialects as an accusative singular, but this usage is dated and less common.  The word translates to 'your' or 'yours' in English."
