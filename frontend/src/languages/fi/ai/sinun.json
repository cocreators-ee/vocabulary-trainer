  "context": "The Finnish word 'sinun' is the possessive form of the pronoun 'sinä' meaning 'you'. It's used to indicate that something belongs to or relates to the person being addressed in an informal way. In Finnish, possessive pronouns change depending on the relationship between the speaker and the listener (formal vs. informal) and number (singular vs. plural). 'Sinun' specifically indicates possession by a single person being spoken to informally."
