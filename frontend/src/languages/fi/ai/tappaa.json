  "context": "The Finnish verb 'tappaa' means to kill or murder. It is a transitive verb that requires an object - someone or something being killed. In its basic form, it's used for present tense, and when conjugated into other tenses, it can show different aspects of the action (e.g., past tense 'tappoi' indicates completed killing). The word has strong connotations of causing death to another living being."
