The form provided ('kasvaa') is the present tense, third-person singular form (he/she/it grows).  It can also mean to increase or develop. The word stems from Proto-Finnic *kasvadak and has cognates in other Finno-Permic languages like Estonian 'kasvama'. It conjugates based on person and number, as shown in the dictionary definition."
