  "context": "The Finnish word 'portti' is a noun that means gate, door, or entrance. It can refer to an actual physical gate or doorway in a wall, fence, or building, but also metaphorically to the entrance of something like a website portal or any kind of entry point. In Finnish, it's a common noun with no specific grammatical gender, and would be declined in different cases depending on its role in a sentence."
