  "context": "The Finnish word 'koska' is a conjunction that primarily means 'because' or 'since'. It introduces the reason for something. It can also function as an adverb meaning 'when', though this usage is less common. There are negative contractions of 'koska' with the verb 'ei', but these are becoming less frequent due to potential confusion with other forms. In rare, slang contexts it can be used like the preposition 'takia' which means 'because of'."
