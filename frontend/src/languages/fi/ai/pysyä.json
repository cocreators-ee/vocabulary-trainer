  "context": "The Finnish verb 'pysyä' means 'to stay', 'to remain', or 'to hold'. It is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn’t take a direct object. The word can be used to describe physically staying in a place ('Today we intend to stay home'), remaining in a state ('Pekka remained unmarried for his whole life'), or holding onto something ('The hat did not stay on').  It conjugates based on person and tense, as shown in the dictionary definition."
