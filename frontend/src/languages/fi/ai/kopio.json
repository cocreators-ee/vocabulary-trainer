  "context": "The word 'kopio' in Finnish means 'copy'. It can refer to a physical duplicate of something, like a document or photograph. It is also used in the context of telecommunications and email to mean a carbon copy. The noun declines based on case; for example, 'kopion' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of a copy', while 'kopiot' is the nominative plural form meaning 'copies'. Possessive forms exist as well, such as 'kopioni' which means 'my copy'."
