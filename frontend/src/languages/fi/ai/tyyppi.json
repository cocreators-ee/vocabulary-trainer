  "context": "In Finnish, 'tyyppi' is a loanword from English that functions as both a noun and an adjective. As a noun, it means 'type', 'kind', or 'sort'. In colloquial usage, it's also commonly used to refer to a person, similar to how 'guy' or 'character' might be used in English. The word can appear in various contexts from technical descriptions (tyyppi - type) to casual references to people (tuo tyyppi - that guy)."
