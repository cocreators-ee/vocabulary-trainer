  "context": "\"Hänen\" is a Finnish possessive pronoun that means 'his', 'her', or 'its' in English. It indicates possession and agrees with the gender of the possessed object rather than the possessor. This word shows possession for third person singular (he/she/it) and can be used before nouns to indicate ownership."
