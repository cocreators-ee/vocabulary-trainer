  "context": "The Finnish word 'vielä' is used as an adverb that can mean 'still', 'yet', or 'even'. It's often placed at the end of sentences in questions (with '-ko/kö' attached) and indicates continuation of a state, lack of completion, or surprise/emphasis. When used at the end of statements, it typically means 'still', while in questions it can ask if something is still true or not yet happened."
