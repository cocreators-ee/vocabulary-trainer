  "context": "The Finnish word 'vielä' is an adverb with multiple meanings depending on the context. It can mean 'yet', indicating something hasn't happened up to this point, as in 'not yet'. It also translates to 'still', meaning something continues to be true or exist. Additionally, it can signify 'even' when emphasizing a comparison ('even larger').  It can also mean 'another' or 'more', and even 'once more'. The wiktionary definition notes that it is often used in negative sentences."
