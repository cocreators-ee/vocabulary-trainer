  "context": "The word 'oikeudenmukainen' means fair, just or equitable in Finnish. It is an adjective that describes someone or something that treats everyone equally and according to the rules of law or morality. The word is derived from 'oikeus', which means right or justice, and 'mukainen', meaning conforming or suitable.  The dictionary shows a full declension of the word, indicating how it changes based on its grammatical role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). It also has different forms for singular and plural, as well as possessive forms showing who owns something that is 'oikeudenmukainen'. For example, 'juhlamme' means 'our celebration', so the 'mme' indicates possession."
