  "context": "The Finnish word 'ulos' is an adverb meaning 'out', 'outside', or 'away'. It indicates movement to a location outside of something, or simply leaving. The word is derived from 'ulko-', which relates to the exterior.  It can be used as a command ('Ulos!' - Get out!) or as part of a sentence describing going somewhere ('Menen ulos.' - I'm going out)."
