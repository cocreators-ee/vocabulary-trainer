  "context": "The Finnish word 'hoito' refers to care, treatment, or therapy. It can describe the act of looking after someone in need, maintaining something, or a specific medical procedure. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'hoidot' is the plural form meaning 'cares' or 'treatments'. Possessive forms also exist to indicate who is receiving or providing the care (e.g., 'hoitoni' means 'my care')."
