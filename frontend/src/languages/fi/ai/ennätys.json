  "context": "The word 'ennätys' in Finnish means 'record', as in the most extreme known value of some achievement. It can be declined into different forms depending on its role in a sentence, and possessive forms exist to indicate who owns the record. For example, 'ennätykseni' means 'my record'. The word is used in many compound words related to records in various fields like sports ('ennätysaika' - record time)."
