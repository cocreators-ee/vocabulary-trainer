  "context": "The Finnish verb 'harkita' means to consider or think about something carefully before making a decision. It implies taking time to evaluate options and possibilities. The word is derived from the noun 'harkinta' which refers to consideration or deliberation. In its basic form, it's used when talking about considering things in general. When conjugated with '-nne' as in 'harkinneet', it becomes a past participle indicating that the consideration has already taken place."
