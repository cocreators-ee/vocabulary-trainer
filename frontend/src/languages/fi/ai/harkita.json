  "context": "The Finnish verb 'harkita' means to deliberate, consider, or reflect upon something. It implies a careful thought process before making a decision. The word originates from the idea of dragging a tool through water to search for something, and evolved to mean searching for the right answer by thinking things through.  It is a transitive verb, meaning it usually takes an object (e.g., 'asiaa' - the matter). The conjugation shows different tenses and persons, indicating who is doing the considering and when."
