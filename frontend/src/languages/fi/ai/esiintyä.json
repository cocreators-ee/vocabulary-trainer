  "context": "The Finnish verb 'esiintyä' means to appear, put in an appearance, show up, or perform. It can also mean to behave or act a certain way. The word is intransitive and has many different forms depending on the context and tense. For example, 'esiinny' is the imperative form meaning 'perform!' or 'show yourself!'. The word can be used in various contexts, from theatrical performances to simply showing up at an event. It also appears in impersonal constructions like 'Suomessa ei esiinny öljyä', which means 'There are no oil deposits in Finland'."
