  "context": "In Finnish, 'koko' is an adjective that means 'whole', 'entire', or 'complete'. It's used to indicate something in its entirety without any parts missing. For example, when referring to a whole family ('koko perhe'), an entire book ('koko kirja'), or the complete truth ('koko totuus'). The word doesn't change form based on gender but may need to be declined according to case and number agreement with the noun it modifies."
