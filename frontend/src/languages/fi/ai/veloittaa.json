  "context": "The Finnish word 'veloittaa' can be translated as 'to charge', 'to invoice', or 'to require/obligate'. It has multiple meanings depending on context - it can refer to billing someone for goods or services (like a doctor's bill), but it can also mean that something requires or obligates someone to do something. The word derives from the root 'velo-' which relates to obligation or debt, similar to how English words with 'debt' relate to financial obligations."
