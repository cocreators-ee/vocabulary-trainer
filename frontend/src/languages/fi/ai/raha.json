  "context": "The word 'raha' in Finnish means money. It can refer to money in general (singular form 'raha') or a specific amount of money as a whole (plural form 'rahat'). The distinction is similar to using 'money' versus 'the money' in English.  It originates from the Proto-Germanic word for squirrel skin, which was used as payment before coins and notes were introduced."
