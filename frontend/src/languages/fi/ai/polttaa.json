  "context": "The Finnish verb 'polttaa' means 'to burn'. It is a transitive verb, meaning the object (what is being burned) receives the action. The dictionary definitions show many different uses of this word, including burning physical objects, overheating food, getting a sunburn, distilling alcohol, and even wasting resources.  It can also mean to smoke cigarettes. The form 'polttaa' is the present tense third-person singular indicative form, but it shares the same spelling as the infinitive."
