  "context": "The word 'pieni' is a Finnish adjective that means small or little. It can also refer to something young, like a young child. The word declines depending on the case and number of the noun it modifies, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'pienet' is the plural form meaning 'small ones'. You can see possessive forms such as 'pieneneni', which means 'my small one'."
