  "context": "The word 'sotilas' in Finnish means 'soldier'. It refers to someone who serves in the army. The word is inflected, meaning its form changes depending on its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, etc.).  For example, 'sotilaat' is the plural form, meaning 'soldiers'. There are also possessive forms indicating ownership ('sotilaani' - my soldier). It can also refer to a pawn in chess."
