  "context": "The Finnish word 'tarpeeksi' is an adverb that means 'enough' or 'sufficiently'. It modifies verbs to indicate that something has been done in the proper degree, quantity, or quality. 'Tarpeeksi' comes from the root word 'tarpeellinen' (necessary, needed) and the '-ksi' suffix indicating transformation into a state or manner. When used before a verb, it indicates that an action has been performed sufficiently or to an adequate extent. It's often placed after the verb in Finnish sentences."
