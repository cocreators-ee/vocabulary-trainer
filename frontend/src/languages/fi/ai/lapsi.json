  "context": "The word 'lapsi' means 'child' in Finnish. It refers to a person who is below the age of adulthood, and can also refer to a daughter or son. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural (lapset). Possessive suffixes are also added to indicate ownership, like 'lapseni' meaning 'my child'. It is a common noun used in everyday language."
