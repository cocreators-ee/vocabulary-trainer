  "context": "The word 'jompikumpi' means 'either one' or 'one or the other' of two options. It is formed by combining 'jompi' and 'kumpi', both related to choosing between alternatives. The word declines in both parts, meaning both 'jompi' and 'kumpi' change form depending on their grammatical role in a sentence. It can function as a determiner or pronoun, generally treated as singular except in the imperative mood. Plural forms exist for use with plural nouns, like 'jommatkummat häät' (either one of the weddings)."
