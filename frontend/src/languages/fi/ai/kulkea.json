The word often implies movement along a certain route or by a specific means of transportation.  It is inflected based on tense and person, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'kuljen' means 'I go', while 'kulkee' means 'he/she/it goes'. It can also be used to express going *by* something, like 'autolla kulkea' which means 'to go by car'."
