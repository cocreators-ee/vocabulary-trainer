  "context": "The word 'vasen' in Finnish means 'left'. It is an adjective that describes something being on the left side. The word declines depending on its grammatical role in a sentence, as shown in the dictionary definition. There are also possessive forms of the word to indicate ownership (e.g., my left hand). Comparative forms can be created using words like 'enemmän' or 'kauempana', and there are related terms such as 'vasemmisto' meaning 'left-wing'."
