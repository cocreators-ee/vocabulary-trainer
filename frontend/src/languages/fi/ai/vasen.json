  "context": "'Vasen' is the Finnish word for 'left'. It's commonly used to indicate direction, position on the left side, or the left hand. The word can appear in different forms depending on context - for example, 'vasen' is in nominative singular form. When indicating location with 'on' (olla), it would become 'vasemmalla' (inessive case), as in sentences 2 and 3."
