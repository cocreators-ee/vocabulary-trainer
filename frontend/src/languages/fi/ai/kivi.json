  "context": "The word 'kivi' in Finnish means 'stone' or 'rock'. It is a common noun and does not change form based on case unless it is part of a compound word or phrase. The examples show the word used as a subject ('Kivi putosi maahan' - The stone fell to the ground), as part of a plural construction ('Talo on rakennettu kivistä' - The house is built of stones) and as an object ('Hän heitti kiven jokeen' - He threw the stone into the river)."
