  "context": "The word 'virka' in Finnish primarily means 'office', 'position', or 'post'. It can refer to a public sector job, or simply a role someone holds. The declension shows how the word changes based on its grammatical function in a sentence – nominative for the subject, genitive showing possession, partitive indicating an incomplete object, and so on.  The possessive forms indicate who *holds* the office (e.g., 'virkani' means 'my office'). There is also a less common meaning of 'line or row', but this is dialectal."
