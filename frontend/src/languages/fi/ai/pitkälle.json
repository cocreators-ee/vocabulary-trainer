  "context": "In Finnish, 'pitkälle' is an adverb that can be used in several contexts. It primarily means 'far' when referring to physical distance (e.g., walking far into the forest), but it also has metaphorical uses such as 'deeply' (referring to depth or intensity) and 'for a long time' (referring to duration). The word is derived from 'pitkä' meaning 'long', and the '-lle' suffix indicates direction towards something. It can be used with various cases depending on what it modifies."
