  "context": "The word 'kauneus' is a Finnish noun that means 'beauty'. It refers to the quality of being pleasing to the senses or mind. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition; for example, 'kauneuden' is the genitive form meaning 'of beauty', and 'kauneutta' is the partitive form often used when referring to an abstract concept like beauty. It can also be used in possessive forms, such as 'kauneuteni' which means 'my beauty'."
