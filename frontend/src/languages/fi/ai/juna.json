  "context": "The word 'juna' means 'train' in Finnish. It refers to a railroad vehicle used for transporting passengers or goods. The word originates from a Savonian dialectal term meaning 'line, queue', and was coined as the modern sense of 'train' in 1864.  It declines based on case; for example, 'junan' means 'of the train' (genitive), while 'junaa' is used when referring to the train as an object ('the train')."
