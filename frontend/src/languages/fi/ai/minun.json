  "context": "'Minun' is the Finnish possessive pronoun meaning 'my' or 'mine'. It's used to indicate possession and belongs to the genitive case in Finnish grammar. This word comes from the first person singular pronoun 'min채' (I), with the possessive suffix '-n added. In Finnish, possessives are commonly placed before the noun they modify, similar to English. The word can also be used alone as a standalone pronoun when the possessed object is clear from context."
