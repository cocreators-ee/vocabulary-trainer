  "context": "The word 'jää' in Finnish primarily means 'ice', referring to water in a solid state. It can also mean 'to freeze'. Additionally, it is the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb 'jäädä,' which means 'to stay.' The noun 'jää' declines with type 18/maa and has various forms depending on its grammatical case (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.). It also has possessive forms indicating who owns the ice. There are many compound words using 'jää', such as 'ahtojää' meaning 'floe ice'. The word is related to similar words in other Finno-Ugric languages like Estonian 'jää' and Hungarian 'jég'."
