  "context": "The Finnish word 'jää' has two main meanings. As a noun, it means 'ice'. As a verb (infinitive form), it means 'to freeze'. In the examples, we see both uses: first as a noun referring to ice itself, then as a past tense verb indicating something froze in winter, and finally as a noun in the context of ice covering something. Finnish often has the same word for different parts of speech depending on context."
