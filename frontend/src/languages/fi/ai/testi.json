  "context": "The word 'testi' in Finnish translates to 'test' in English. It can refer to any kind of trial, proof, or examination, like a school test, medical test (such as an HIV test), or even a general assessment. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'testin' is the genitive form meaning 'of the test', and 'testeihin' means 'to tests'. It can also be used in possessive forms like 'testini' which means 'my test'."
