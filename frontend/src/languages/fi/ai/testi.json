  "context": "The Finnish word 'testi' is a noun that means 'test', 'examination', or 'trial'. It can refer to academic tests, medical examinations, product trials, or any situation where something is evaluated. In Finnish, it doesn't change form in the nominative case (singular), but would have different endings in other cases (like testiss채 - in the test, testist채 - from the test)."
