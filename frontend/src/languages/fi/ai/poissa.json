  "context": "The Finnish word 'poissa' means away, absent or not here. It's an inessive case form of the verb 'puuttua' (to lack/be missing), but it's commonly used as a standalone adverb to indicate someone's absence or location away from somewhere. The word doesn't change form regardless of gender or number - it remains 'poissa' whether referring to one person or many."
