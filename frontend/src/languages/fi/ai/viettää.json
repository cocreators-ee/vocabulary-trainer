  "context": "The Finnish verb 'viettää' is primarily used to describe spending time or passing time in a particular way. It's commonly followed by an object indicating the duration of time (like 'viikonloppu' - weekend, 'ilta' - evening) and how it's spent (often with the adessive case: 'perheen kanssa' - with family). The verb can also be used in contexts of celebrating occasions or events."
