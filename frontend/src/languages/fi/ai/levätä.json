  "context": "The Finnish verb 'levätä' means to rest, take a break, or lie down. It can also refer to someone who is deceased resting in their grave. The word comes from Proto-Finnic roots and has cognates in Estonian and Veps languages.  It’s an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn't typically take a direct object. The forms shown include the present tense ('lepää'), past tense ('lepäsi'), and various conjugations for different persons and numbers. For example, 'lepäämme' means 'we rest'. It can also be used in passive voice like 'levätään', meaning 'one rests/is resting'."
