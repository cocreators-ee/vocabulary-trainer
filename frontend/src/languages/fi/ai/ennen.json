  "context": "The Finnish word 'ennen' is an adverb that means 'before' in time. It can be used to indicate something happening at a prior point in time, either immediately before or further back in the past. In some contexts it may also carry a meaning of 'previously' or 'earlier'. The word typically appears sentence-initially but can appear elsewhere depending on emphasis."
