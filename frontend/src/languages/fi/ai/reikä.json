  "context": "The Finnish word 'reikä' primarily means a hole, but can also refer to cuts, tears or cavities. It has several grammatical forms depending on its role in the sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). The word can even be used slang for zero or as a vulgar term for female genitalia.  The ending '-n' often indicates the genitive case, showing possession ('of a hole'). The plural form is 'reiät'."
