  "context": "The Finnish word 'iho' refers to the skin of a human being or an animal. It is a Kotus type 1/valo noun with no gradation, meaning it declines according to a specific pattern in Finnish grammar. The dictionary definitions show various forms of the word including nominative, genitive, partitive cases for both singular and plural forms, as well as possessive forms indicating who owns the skin (my skin, your skin, etc.). It can also be used in compounds like 'appelsiini-iho' which means orange peel skin."
