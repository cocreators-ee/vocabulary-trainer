  "context": "The Finnish word 'massa' refers to a quantity of matter cohering together to make one body, or a large amount of something. It can also refer to a soft mixture like paste or pulp. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural nouns, and possessive suffixes indicating who owns the mass. For example, 'massani' means 'my mass', while 'massoissani' means 'in my masses'. It can also be used to describe a large group of people, similar to 'the masses'."
