  "context": "In Finnish, 'massa' is a noun that generally refers to an amount or quantity of something. It can be used for physical mass in scientific contexts, but more commonly it's used to describe a large quantity or pile of material goods. For example, it might refer to a large amount of food, materials, or substances. The word doesn't carry any negative connotations and is a neutral term describing quantity."
