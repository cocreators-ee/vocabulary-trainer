  "context": "The Finnish verb 'katsella' means 'to watch'. It implies a less focused or more casual way of watching compared to the verb 'katsoa'. The '-lla' ending in forms like 'katsella' indicates it is an infinitive form.  It can be conjugated into different tenses and persons, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'katselee' means 'he/she/it watches', while 'katselimme' means 'we watched'."
