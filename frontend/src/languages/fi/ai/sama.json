  "context": "The Finnish word 'sama' is an adjective that means 'the same'. It's used to indicate equality or similarity between things, people, or situations. In different contexts, it can be translated as 'same', 'similar', or 'equal'. The word doesn't change form for gender but does change for number - 'samat' would be the plural form meaning 'the same ones'."
