  "context": "The Finnish word 'sama' generally means 'same'. It can function as a determiner, indicating that something is the same as another thing.  It declines based on case, which affects its meaning in a sentence; for example, 'saman verran' means 'the same amount (of)'. The word also appears in many compound words."
