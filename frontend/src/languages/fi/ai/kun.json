  "context": "The Finnish word 'kun' is a conjunction that introduces time-related clauses, similar to the English words 'when', 'while', or 'as'. It's used to indicate that something happens at the same time as another action or event. In Finnish grammar, 'kun' can connect two clauses where one clause describes the time context for the main clause."
