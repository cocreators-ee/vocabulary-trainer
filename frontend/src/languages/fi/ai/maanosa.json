  "context": "The word 'maanosa' in Finnish translates to 'continent' or 'landmass' in English. It is a compound word formed from 'maa' (earth) and 'osa' (part). The declension table shows how the word changes based on its grammatical role in a sentence, indicating singular and plural forms as well as different cases like nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.  The possessive forms indicate who owns or is associated with the continent. For example, 'maanosamme' means 'our continent'. It can refer to both geographical continents and cultural/historical divisions."
