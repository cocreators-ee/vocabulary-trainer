  "context": "The Finnish word 'painatus' refers to the process of printing or printed materials. It is derived from the verb 'painaa' (to press/print) with the suffix '-us', which in Finnish often indicates a process or result. This noun typically describes the action of putting ink on paper through mechanical means, or it can refer to the printed products themselves."
