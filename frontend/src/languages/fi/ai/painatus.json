  "context": "The word 'painatus' in Finnish refers to the act or result of printing, such as a picture or text created by pressing ink onto a surface. It can also refer to an edition of a book or other publication. The word is declined based on case, with different forms indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). For example 'painatukseni' means 'my print', and 'painatuksemme' means 'our print'. It belongs to the Kotus type 39/vastaus declension group."
