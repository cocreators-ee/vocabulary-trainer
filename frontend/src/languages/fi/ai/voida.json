  "context": "The Finnish word 'voida' is a versatile verb meaning 'can', 'to be able to', or 'to be capable'. It’s used to express ability, possibility, and even permission.  It can also be used to inquire about someone's wellbeing ('How are you?'). The form of the word changes depending on the tense and person (I can, you can, he/she can etc.). For example, 'en voi' means 'I cannot', while 'voimme' means 'we can'. It is important to note that past forms are often replaced with synonyms like 'kyetä' or 'pystyä'."
