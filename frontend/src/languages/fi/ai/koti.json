  "context": "The word 'koti' in Finnish means 'home'. It refers to the place where someone lives, their house or dwelling. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.).  It can also be used possessively, like 'kotini' meaning 'my home'. The plural form is 'kodit'."
