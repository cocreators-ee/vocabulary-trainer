  "context": "The word 'vaara' in Finnish means danger or risk. It can refer to a physical hazard, like a dangerous situation in the forest, or an abstract risk, such as putting one’s life at risk. The word declines based on case; for example, 'vaarassa' means 'in danger', and 'vaaran' is the genitive form meaning 'of danger'. It also has possessive forms to indicate who or what something is in danger of."
