  "context": "The Finnish word 'takana' is an adposition that means 'behind' or 'at the back of'. It indicates location in relation to something, positioning an object behind another. In Finnish grammar, it's used with the elative case (-sta/-st√§) when specifying what something is behind, so you would say 'takana jostakin' (behind something). The word can be used literally for physical positions as well as metaphorically."
