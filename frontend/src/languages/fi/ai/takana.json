  "context": "The word 'takana' in Finnish primarily means 'behind'. It functions as a postposition, taking the genitive or possessive form of the noun it modifies.  It can also mean 'around' (when following a curved path) and has nautical uses like 'aft of' or 'astern of'. The word is derived from 'taka', and its inflection shows various cases including nominative, genitive, partitive, and more. It can be used with personal pronouns to indicate position relative to someone ('behind me', 'behind you')."
