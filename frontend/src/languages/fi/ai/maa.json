  "context": "The Finnish word 'maa' is a very common and versatile word with multiple meanings. It can refer to physical land or ground, like the surface of the Earth, but also to countries or territories. The specific meaning often depends on the case form used with the word. For example, the internal locative cases usually mean 'ground, land', while external locative cases are more likely to indicate 'countryside'. It can also refer to a plot of land someone owns.  The suffix '-maa' is frequently added to other words to create nouns related to land or location (e.g., metsämaa - forest land)."
