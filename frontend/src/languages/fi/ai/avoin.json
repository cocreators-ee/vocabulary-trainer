It can refer to physical openness, like a door being open, or a more abstract openness, such as someone having an open mind. The word declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show various forms for singular and plural nouns, including nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.  The suffix '-in' can indicate possession (e.g., 'avoimeni' means 'my open')."
