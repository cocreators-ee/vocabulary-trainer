  "context": "The Finnish adjective 'avoin' means open in English. It can refer to physical openness (like an open door), accessibility of something, or availability. In different contexts, it might describe a person who is approachable and not secretive, or a question that hasn't been resolved yet. The word doesn't change form based on gender but does have comparative forms like 'avompi' (more open) and superlative 'avoimin' (most open)."
