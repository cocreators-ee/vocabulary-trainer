  "context": "The word 'isä' in Finnish means 'father'. It refers to a male parent. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, which affects its form depending on its role in a sentence. For example, 'isän' is the genitive form meaning 'of father', and 'isälle' is the dative form meaning 'to father'. It can also be used figuratively to mean a pioneering figure or progenitor."
