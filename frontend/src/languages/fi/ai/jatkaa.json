  "context": "The Finnish verb 'jatkaa' means to continue, keep on, go on, or proceed. It is a transitive verb that can also mean to extend or lengthen something. The form 'jatkaa' is the present tense indicative third-person singular form of the verb, and it does not exhibit final gemination unlike other forms.  The verb conjugates based on person and number, as shown in the dictionary definition. For example, 'jatkan' means 'I continue', while 'jatkat' means 'you continue'. It can also be used with a partitive of a verbal noun to mean 'keep on doing something', like 'Jatka opiskelemista' which translates to 'Keep on studying'."
