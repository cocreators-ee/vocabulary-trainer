  "context": "The Finnish word 'ylös' is an adverb that means 'up' or 'upwards'. It indicates movement from a lower position to a higher position. The word can be used with the verb mennä (to go) as in mennään ylös (let's go up), or with other verbs indicating upward direction like katsoa (to look) - katsoa ylös (to look up). It's one of the most basic directional words in Finnish and is commonly used in everyday conversation."
