  "context": "The word 'teräs' in Finnish means 'steel'. It refers to an alloy of iron and carbon, known for its strength and resilience. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, indicating its role in a sentence (nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.). It can also refer figuratively to something extremely hard or resilient, or even to bullets/projectiles."
