  "context": "The Finnish word 'osake' refers to a share of stock, representing ownership in a company. It can also refer to an apartment owned within a housing cooperative or company (asunto-osakeyhtiö). The word declines based on case and number, as shown in the dictionary definition, indicating possession and grammatical role in a sentence. For example, 'osakkeeni' means 'my share', while 'osakkeita' is the partitive plural form meaning 'shares'."
