  "context": "The Finnish word 'kukka' means 'flower' in English. It's a common noun referring to the colorful, often fragrant part of plants that is used for reproduction. In Finnish grammar, 'kukka' follows regular noun conjugation patterns. When pluralized, it becomes 'kukat', meaning 'flowers'. The word can also be used in various contexts like describing someone as beautiful (e.g., 'sinä olet kukka'), though this is more poetic and less common."
