  "context": "The word 'kisko' in Finnish refers to a long piece of metal, most commonly used as a rail for railroads. It can also simply mean 'bar'. The word originates from the birchbark and has evolved over time to describe metal rails.  It declines based on grammatical case; the provided dictionary definitions show its various forms (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.) for both singular and plural, as well as possessive forms indicating who owns the rail ('my rail', 'your rail' etc.)."
