  "context": "The Finnish word 'minä' is the first-person singular pronoun, meaning 'I'. It comes from Proto-Finnic and Proto-Uralic roots. Like in many other languages, it can be omitted when the verb conjugation already indicates the person. The dictionary definitions show various forms of the word including genitive ('minun'), partitive ('minua') and accusative ('minut'). There are also possessive forms like 'minäni' (my). Colloquial variations include 'mä'."
