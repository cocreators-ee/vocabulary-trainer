  "context": "The word 'idea' in Finnish refers to a thought, concept, or plan. It originates from Latin and Ancient Greek roots meaning 'notion' or 'pattern'. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural subjects and objects. For example, 'ideani' means 'my idea', while 'ideoitani' means 'my ideas'."
