  "context": "The Finnish word 'hyönteinen' refers to an insect or bug in English. It's a noun that describes small arthropod creatures with six legs and often wings. The word follows typical Finnish grammar rules, where the ending '-nen' indicates singular form, and when pluralized it becomes hyönteisiä. Insects are important for ecosystems as pollinators, decomposers, and food sources in various habitats."
