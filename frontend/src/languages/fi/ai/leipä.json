  "context": "The word 'leipä' in Finnish means 'bread'. It can refer to bread as a foodstuff, any variety of bread, or even a loaf of bread. The word comes from Proto-Finnic *laipa and is related to Estonian 'leib' and Germanic words like German 'Laib' and English 'loaf'.  It declines based on case; the provided declension table shows how it changes in different grammatical contexts (nominative, genitive, partitive etc.). It can also be used figuratively to mean livelihood or sustenance. The possessive forms show ownership ('my bread', 'your bread' etc.)."
