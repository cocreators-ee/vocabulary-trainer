  "context": "The word 'pankki' in Finnish translates to 'bank' in English. It can refer to a financial institution, a branch office of a bank, or even the bench in some contexts (though less common). The provided declension table shows how the word changes based on its grammatical role in a sentence – nominative for the subject, genitive showing possession, partitive indicating an incomplete object, and so on.  The possessive forms indicate whose bank it is (my bank, your bank, etc.)."
