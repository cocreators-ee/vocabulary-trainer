  "context": "The Finnish word 'mukaan' is a versatile postposition and adverb that generally indicates movement *with* something or someone, or acting *according to* a certain standard. It often appears after a genitive noun indicating who or what you are going with (e.g., 'hänen mukaansa' - along with her/him). The word can also mean 'by' as in 'lain mukaan' - by law.  The inflections show how it changes based on the possessor, such as 'mukaani' meaning 'with me', and 'mukaanne' meaning 'with you (plural)'."
