  "context": "The word 'laakso' in Finnish means 'valley'. It refers to a low area of land between hills or mountains. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, with different forms for singular and plural, nominative, genitive, partitive, and other cases. For example, 'laaksot' is the plural nominative form meaning 'valleys', while 'laakson' is the genitive singular form meaning 'of the valley'. The possessive forms also change depending on who owns the valley (my valley, your valley etc.)."
