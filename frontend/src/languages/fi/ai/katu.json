  "context": "The Finnish word 'katu' translates to 'street' in English. It refers to a paved part of a road within a town or village, typically with sidewalks on either side. The word declines based on grammatical case; for example, 'kadun' means 'of the street', and 'katua' is used as the partitive form.  The possessive forms change depending on who owns the street (e.g., 'katuni' - my street)."
