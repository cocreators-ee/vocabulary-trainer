  "context": "The Finnish word 'muoto' is a noun that refers to the external appearance or structure of something. It can mean form, shape, figure, or design depending on context. In its basic form (nominative singular), it's used to describe how something looks physically. The word doesn't change in meaning based on case alone but would have different forms in different grammatical cases - for example, 'muodon' in the genitive case would mean 'of the form'. This is a common Finnish noun that appears frequently when describing objects, people, or abstract concepts."
