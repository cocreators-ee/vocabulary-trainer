  "context": "The word 'muoto' in Finnish translates to shape, form or figure in English. It can refer to the physical appearance of something, but also to a more abstract concept like the way something is organized or expressed. The word declines based on grammatical case, as shown in the dictionary definitions provided. For example, 'muodon' means 'of the shape', and 'muotoa' means 'shape (partitive)'."
