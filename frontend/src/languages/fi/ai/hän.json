  "context": "The Finnish word 'hän' is a third-person personal pronoun, meaning he, she, or they. It’s gender-neutral and refers specifically to people. However, in modern colloquial Finnish, 'se' is more commonly used for the third person, with 'hän' being reserved for specific contexts like indirect speech or when emphasizing who another speaker is talking about. The word declines based on case; for example, 'hänet' is the accusative form. It’s important to note that unlike first and second-person pronouns, 'hän' isn’t usually omitted even though the verb indicates person and number."
