  "context": "The Finnish word 'lattia' means floor in English. It refers to the surface on which one walks or stands inside a building. In Finnish grammar, it's a noun that follows normal declension patterns for common gender words (it doesn't have grammatical gender but declines similarly). When used in different cases, it can indicate location ('lattialla' - on the floor), destination ('lattialle' - to the floor), or other spatial relationships. The word is commonly used in everyday Finnish when talking about building interiors, cleaning, movement within rooms, and architectural descriptions."
