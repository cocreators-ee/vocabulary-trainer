  "context": "The Finnish word 'runo' means poem. It can refer to a single poem or poetry in general. The word has roots in Proto-Norse and Proto-Germanic languages, related to words like 'rune' in English and 'runa' in Swedish.  It declines based on grammatical case; the provided dictionary definitions show nominative, genitive, partitive, and other cases for both singular and plural forms. The possessive forms indicate who owns the poem (my poem, your poem, etc.)."
