  "context": "The word 'huone' in Finnish means 'room'. It can also refer to a house or building, but is most commonly used for a separate part of a building enclosed by walls, a floor and a ceiling. The word declines based on case; for example, 'huoneen' is the genitive form meaning 'of the room', and 'huoneessa' means 'in the room'. It can also be used in possessive forms like 'huoneeni' which means 'my room'."
