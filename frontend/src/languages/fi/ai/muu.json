  "context": "The Finnish word 'muu' is an adjective that means 'other', 'another', 'different', or 'else'. It's used to refer to something that is not the one already mentioned or different from what has been specified. In Finnish grammar, it's a declinable word that changes form based on case and number. For example, in the nominative singular it's 'muu', but in the plural form it becomes 'muut'. It can also appear in other cases like 'muun' (genitive singular) or 'muussa' (inessive singular)."
