  "context": "The Finnish word 'iloinen' is an adjective that means happy, joyful, or cheerful. It comes from the root word 'ilo', which means joy. The '-inen' suffix turns the noun into an adjective.  It declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show all forms of the word. For example, 'iloiset' is the plural nominative form meaning 'happy ones'. You can also see possessive forms like 'iloiseni', which means 'my happy'."
