  "context": "The word 'rauta' in Finnish means 'iron'. It can refer to the metal itself, a tool made of iron or steel, or even be used figuratively. The word declines based on case, as shown in the dictionary definition, and has different forms depending on possession (my iron, your iron etc.). It is often found in compounds, describing things *made* of iron."
