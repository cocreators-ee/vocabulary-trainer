  "context": "The word 'saalis' in Finnish refers to something that is obtained as a result of hunting or catching, like prey or a kill. It can also refer to loot or plunder. The word declines based on case and number; the provided dictionary definitions show various forms for singular and plural nouns, including genitive, partitive, illative cases, and different possessive forms indicating who owns the 'saalis'. For example, 'saaliinsa' means 'its prey', while 'saaliimme' means 'our prey'."
