  "context": "The Finnish word 'ehkä' is an adverb that means 'perhaps' or 'maybe'. It expresses uncertainty. The dictionary definitions show negative contractions of the word, which are used with the negative verb 'ei', but the basic form 'ehkä' is commonly used on its own as well. It can also be used as a conjunction meaning 'although' though this usage is archaic."
